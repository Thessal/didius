Title: New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems
Year: 1978
The Parabolic Time/Price System derives its name from the fact that when charted, the pattern formed by the stops resembles a parabola, or if you will, a French Curve. The system allows room for the market to react for the first few days after a trade is initiated and then the stop begins to move more rapidly. The stop is not only a function of price, but is also a function of time. The stop never backs up. It moves an incremental amount every day, only in the direction in which the trade has been initiated.
For example, if you are Long, the stop will move UP every day regardless of the direction the price is moving. This is the TIME function. The stop is also a function of PRICE because the distance the stop moves up is relative to the favorable distance the price has moved... specifically, the most favorable price reached since the trade was initiated. This TIME/PRICE concept is most intriguing. In effect, it allows just so much time for the price to move favorably. If the move does not materialize or goes the other way, the stop reverses the position and a new time period begins. This concept is illustrated in the hypothetical illustration (Fig. 2.1).
Notice that the price is moving up exactly the same amount each day. Notice also the pattern formed by the stops. The stop accelerates gradually at first, but then begins to move up rapidly. On the 10th day, the stop is no longer accelerating but becomes a function of price only.
First, let's look at the concept of this system by learning how the stops were calculated in the illustration. Let's say that we entered this Long trade on Day 4. The stop for the first day in the trade, Day 4, is the SIP. (We have previously defined the SIP as the extreme price point reached while in the previous trade.) Assume that our previous trade was Short and we are now reversing to Long on Day 4. The stop, then, is 50.00 for the day of entry.
This system is a true reversal system; that is, every stop point is also a reverse point. We will therefore call each stop point a SAR, which stands for Stop and Reverse. On the first day of entry, our SAR is the SIP. We are now ready to calculate the SAR for Day 5.
Take the highest price reached on Day 4, subtract from this price the SAR for Day 4 and multiply this distance by the acceleration factor, 0.02, and then add this amount back to the SAR for Day 4. The result becomes the SAR for Day 5. The equation is as follows:
SAR5 = SAR4 + AF * (H4 - SAR4)
Substituting in the above equation:
SAR5 = 50.00 + 0.02 * (52.50 - 50.00)
SAR5 = 50.00 + 0.02 * 2.50
SAR5 = 50.00 + 0.05
SAR5 = 50.05
The SAR for Day 5 then is 50.05. The ACCELERATION FACTOR (AF) is one of a progression of numbers beginning at 0.02 and ending at 0.20. The AF is increased by 0.02 each day that a new high is made. In this example, a new high is made every day; therefore the AF is increased by 0.02 every day. The SAR for Day 6 would be calculated as follows:
SAR6 = SAR5 + AF * (H5 - SAR5)
SAR6 = 50.05 + 0.04 * (53.00 - 50.05)
SAR6 = 50.05 + 0.04 * 2.95
SAR6 = 50.05 + 0.12
SAR6 = 50.17
The general equation, then, is as follows:
SAR_Tomorrow = SAR_Today + AF(EP_Trade - SAR_Today)
Where AF begins at .02 and is increased by .02 until a value of .20 is reached;
EP = Extreme Price Point for the trade made so far (if Long, EP is the extreme high price for the trade; if Short, EP is the extreme low price for the trade).
The equations for the SAR for Days 7 through 12 on the chart are as follows:
SAR7 = 50.17 + .06 * (53.50 - 50.17) = 50.37
SAR8 = 50.87 + .08 * (54.00 - 50.37) = 50.66
SAR9 = 50.86 + .10 * (54.50 - 50.66) = 51.04
SAR10 = 51.04 + .12 * (55.00 - 51.04) = 51.52
SAR11 = 51.52 + .14 * (55.50 - 51.52) = 52.08
SAR12 = 52.08 + .16 * (56.00 - 52.08) = 52.71
Now that we understand the concept upon which this system is based, let's state the rules to be used in trading the system.
RULES : PARABOLIC TIME/PRICE SYSTEM
ENTRY: A position is entered when a price penetrates the SAR.
STOP AND REVERSE (SAR):
A. For the first day of entry, the SAR is the previous SIP (Significant Point)
1. If entered Long the SIP is the LOWEST price reached while in the previous Short trade.
2. If entered Short, the SIP is the HIGHEST price reached while in the previous Long trade.
B. For the second day and thereafter, the SAR is calculated as follows:
1. If Long: a. Find the difference between the highest price made while in the trade and the SAR for today. Multiply the difference by the AF and add the result to the SAR today to obtain the SAR for tomorrow. b. Use .02 for the first AF and increase its value by .02 on every day that a new high for the trade is made. If a new high is not made, continue to use the AF as last increased. DO NOT INCREASE THE AF ABOVE .20.
2. If Short: a. Find the difference between the lowest price made while in the trade and the SAR for today. Multiply the difference by the AF and subtract the result from the SAR today to obtain the SAR for tomorrow. b. Use .02 for the first AF and increase its value by .02 on every day that a new low for the trade is made. If a new low is not made, continue to use the AF as last increased. DO NOT INCREASE THE AF ABOVE .20.
C. Never move the SAR into the previous day's range or today's range.
1. If Long, never move the SAR for tomorrow above the previous day's low or today's low. If the SAR is calculated to be above the previous day's low or today's low, then use the lower low between today and the previous day as the new SAR. Make the next day's calculations based upon this SAR.
2. If Short, never move the SAR for tomorrow below the previous day's high or today's high. If the SAR is calculated to be below the previous day's high or today's high, then use the higher high between today and the previous day as the new SAR. Make the next day's calculations based upon this SAR.
Now let's look at a hypothetical example on the worksheet which is illustrated on the following chart (Fig. 2.2). For this example we will assume that we were reversed from a Short position to a Long position on Day 4. On the initial day of entry we can give our broker the SAR without making any calculations because we know the lowest point reached while in the previous Short trade was 50.00 (which was the LOW & LP). We are now ready to calculate the SAR for the following day.
On the worksheet we have filled out only the High and Low columns for simplicity; actually, following the system you would want to fill in the Open and Close columns also.
On Day 4 we insert the high of 52.35 and the low of 51.50. Under Column #1 we insert the SAR for today, which, for the first day in the trade, is always the previous SAR, so we put 50.00 in Column #1.
ur Extreme Price for the first day in the trade is the high made during that day, and we put 52.35 in Column #2 under EP (Extreme Price). We then take the difference between 50.00
