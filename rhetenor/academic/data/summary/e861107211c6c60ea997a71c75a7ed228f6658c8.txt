A cross of the Tenkan‑sen (conversion line) above the Kijun‑sen (base line) indicates an increase in the asset’s price if it occurs above the cloud.  
If the Tenkan‑sen/Kijun‑sen cross occurs within the cloud, it is considered neutral, and if it occurs below the cloud it suggests a low likelihood of a positive price movement.  
A Tenkan‑sen crossing below the Kijun‑sen indicates a bearish move in the price.  
Some experts require the Chikō Span to be above the current market price as confirmation of Ichimoku signals.  
The traditional Ichimoku settings use a 9/26/52 period, but traders have adapted settings such as 10/30/60 or 20/60/120 for different assets or markets.  
Shorter Ichimoku timeframes (e.g., 9/26/52) increase the likelihood of false signals, while longer settings may delay signal visibility and cause traders to miss price movements.  
Ichimoku charts are most commonly used by equities, futures, and foreign exchange traders who combine Ichimoku signals with risk‑management tools such as trailing stop‑loss orders.  
Backtesting has shown that Ichimoku tends to underperform the market index significantly, indicating limitations in its predictive power.  
When the current market price is inside the cloud, it signals a decline in the security’s value.
