A price that is inside the Ichimoku cloud signals a decline in the security’s value.  
A Tenkan‑sen crossing above the Kijun‑sen above the cloud indicates an expected increase in the asset’s price.  
If the Tenkan‑sen crosses above the Kijun‑sen within the cloud, the signal is considered neutral, and a cross below the cloud suggests a low likelihood of a positive price movement.  
A Tenkan‑sen crossing below the Kijun‑sen indicates a bearish move in the price.  
Some experts require the Chikō Span to be above the current market price as confirmation of Ichimoku signals.  
The traditional Ichimoku settings use a 9/26/52 period, but traders have adapted settings such as 10/30/60 or 20/60/120 for different assets or markets.  
Shorter Ichimoku timeframes (e.g., 9/26/52) increase the likelihood of false signals, while longer timeframes may delay signal visibility and cause traders to miss price movements.  
Ichimoku charts are most commonly used by equities, futures, and foreign‑exchange traders who combine them with risk‑management tools such as trailing stop‑loss orders.  
Backtesting has shown that Ichimoku tends to underperform the market index significantly, indicating limitations in its predictive power.
