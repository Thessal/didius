The 1/16-point (6.25 cents) threshold assumes that a 7‑cent price move is rounded up to the old 1/8‑point increment (12.5 cents) and counted as advancing or declining, while moves of 6 cents or less are rounded to unchanged.  
The sub‑tick group (price changes ≤ 1/16 point) has a weaker bias than the overall market and reduces the Composite Cumulative advance‑decline ratio, preventing an even more bullish picture.  
Decimalization has not artificially inflated breadth statistics.  
Many NYSE issues are not “real” companies, including preferred stocks, rights, warrants, and closed‑end funds.  
Analysts sometimes “purify” the advance‑decline line by selecting only certain stocks (e.g., S&P 500) or excluding specific issues, but determining which stocks to include is difficult.  
Large conglomerates such as General Electric or Danaher resemble mutual‑fund holdings, making exclusion from the advance‑decline line problematic.  
Composite advance‑decline statistics are calculated by data vendors from raw exchange feeds, not directly by the NYSE.  
The NYSE’s “common‑only” data excludes any issue with a symbol longer than three letters, removing preferred stocks, warrants, and rights but retaining bond funds, closed‑end stock funds, and country funds.  
The Common‑Only advance‑decline line usually appears slightly weaker than the Composite version.  
Subtracting closed‑end fund contributions from the Common‑Only numbers yields a “Pure Common” advance‑decline line that is virtually identical to the Common‑Only line, indicating closed‑end funds have negligible effect on overall numbers.  
All versions of the advance‑decline line topped together in August 1989 and again later; the Composite line reached a higher peak at the later point, providing a clearer indication of overall market strength.  
The Composite advance‑decline line, with its greater diversity of inputs, is a more reliable market indicator than the Common‑Only or Pure Common lines.  
Daily Common‑Only advance‑decline numbers subtracted from Composite numbers produce “Uncommon” advance‑decline statistics that are highly sensitive to interest‑rate movements.  
A healthy Uncommon advance‑decline line (above its long‑term moving average) coincides with strong bond performance, while a weakening Uncommon line predicts weaker bond periods.
