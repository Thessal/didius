A top on January 24 was preceded by an RSI value below 70, indicating the top was less significant and suggesting either a higher top is forming or the long‑term uptrend is losing momentum.  
A pennant formed on the RSI line during October, and a breakout of this triangle indicates an intermediate move in the direction of the breakout.  
A long‑term pennant with many supporting points on the RSI line, when it breaks significantly, should indicate the next long‑term trend.  
Failure swings are most significant after an RSI high around 70 or an RSI low around 30.  
When the RSI reached 70, the immediate down swing fell to 58, and the failure swing was completed when the 58 level was penetrated.  
On August 15 the failure swing rose to an RSI level of 41, and after several small down swings this level was penetrated on the upside on August 26.  
Trend lines on the bar chart often appear as support lines on the RSI.  
Support lines formed by low swing points in October and early November can be used to confirm trend lines drawn on the price chart.  
Divergence does not occur at every turning point, but it does occur at most significant turning points.  
When divergence appears after a strong directional move, it is a very strong indication that a turning point is near.  
Divergence is the single most indicative characteristic of the Relative Strength Index.  
The top on November 9 was indicated by an RSI value above 70 and divergence, and it was confirmed by a failure swing, a breakout of the pennant formation, and a break of the support line.  
The Relative Strength Index, when used together with a bar chart, can provide a new dimension of interpretation for the chart reader.  
No single tool, method, or system can produce correct answers 100 % of the time in trading analysis.  
A successful trader utilizes several different kinds of input into his decisions.  
In this context, the Relative Strength Index can be a valuable input into a trader’s decision‑making process.
