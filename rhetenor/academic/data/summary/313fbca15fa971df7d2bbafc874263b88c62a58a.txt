Calculating the VIX retrospectively for 1929 did not predict the higher volatility experienced during the Great Depression, suggesting that the VIX cannot reliably forecast severe future events under anomalous conditions.  
An academic study by the University of Texas at Austin and Ohio State University examined potential methods of VIX manipulation.  
On February 12, 2018, a whistleblower‑related letter was sent to the CFTC and SEC alleging manipulation of the VIX.  
The implied volatility skew for VIX options is not always symmetric; it can display a “half‑frown” shape with higher implied volatilities on one side of the strike distribution, reflecting market asymmetries in demand for upside or downside protection.  
In 2012, the CBOE introduced the VVIX index, a measure of the VIX’s expected volatility.  
The VVIX is calculated using the same methodology as the VIX, but its inputs are market prices of VIX options.
