Calculating VIX retrospectively in 1929 did not predict the surpassing volatility of the Great Depression, suggesting that VIX cannot weakly predict future severe events under anomalous conditions.  
An academic study from the University of Texas at Austin and Ohio State University examined potential methods of VIX manipulation.  
On February 12, 2018, a whistleblower sent a letter to the CFTC and SEC alleging manipulation of the VIX.  
The implied volatility skew for VIX options is not always symmetric; VIX volatility skews can sometimes resemble a half frown, with higher implied volatilities on one side of the strike distribution, reflecting market asymmetries in demand for upside or downside protection.  
In 2012, the CBOE introduced the VVIX index, a measure of the VIX’s expected volatility.  
VVIX is calculated using the same methodology as VIX, except that the inputs are market prices of VIX options.
