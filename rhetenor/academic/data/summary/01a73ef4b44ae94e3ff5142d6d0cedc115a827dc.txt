The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator indicator used by traders and investors to help identify price reversals, price extremes and trend strength when using technical analysis to analyse financial markets.  
The CCI was originally introduced by Donald Lambert in 1980.  
The CCI has become a very common tool for traders to identify cyclical trends in commodities, equities and currencies.  
The CCI can be adjusted to the timeframe of the market traded on by changing the averaging period.  
CCI measures a security's variation from the statistical mean.  
The CCI is calculated as (1 / 0.015) × (pt − SMA(pt)) / MD(pt), where pt is the typical price, SMA is the simple moving average, and MD is the mean absolute deviation.  
The typical price is defined as (p_high + p_low + p_close) / 3.  
Lambert set the constant at 0.015 to ensure that approximately 70 to 80 percent of CCI values would fall between –100 and +100.  
The CCI fluctuates above and below zero.  
A shorter CCI period will be more volatile with a smaller percentage of values between +100 and –100, whereas a longer period reduces volatility.
