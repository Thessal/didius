The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator indicator used by traders and investors to help identify price reversals, price extremes, and trend strength in financial markets.  
The CCI was originally introduced by Donald Lambert in 1980.  
The CCI has become a common tool for traders to identify cyclical trends in commodities, equities, and currencies.  
The CCI can be adjusted to the timeframe of the market traded by changing the averaging period.  
The CCI measures a security's variation from the statistical mean.  
The CCI is calculated as the difference between the typical price and its simple moving average, divided by the mean absolute deviation of the typical price, and then multiplied by 1/0.015.  
Lambert set the scaling constant at 0.015 so that approximately 70 to 80 percent of CCI values fall between –100 and +100.  
A shorter CCI period results in more volatile values with a smaller percentage of values between +100 and –100.
