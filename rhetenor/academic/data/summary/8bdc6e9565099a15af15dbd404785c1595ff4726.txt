The force index (FI) is an indicator used in technical analysis to illustrate how strong the actual buying or selling pressure is.  
High positive FI values indicate a strong rising trend.  
Low FI values indicate a strong downward trend.  
The FI is calculated by multiplying the difference between the last and previous closing prices by the volume of the commodity, yielding a momentum scaled by the volume.  
The strength of the force is determined by a larger price change or by a larger volume.  
The FI was created by Alexander Elder.
