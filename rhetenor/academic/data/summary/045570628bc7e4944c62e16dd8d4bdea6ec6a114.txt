The KST can give false or misleading signals, as seen from the April 2005 buy signal.  
By and large, the KST is more accurate than the MACD, even though the MACD often turns faster than the KST.  
When the indicator crosses above and below the overbought/oversold zones, momentum buy and sell signals are triggered.  
You must wait for a trend reversal signal in the price, such as a price pattern completion or trendline violation, before acting on overbought/oversold signals.  
The KST often diverges positively and negatively with the price.  
It is possible to construct a trendline on the KST and see when it has been violated, though this occurs not very often.  
When a KST trendline violation occurs, it usually results in a powerful signal.
