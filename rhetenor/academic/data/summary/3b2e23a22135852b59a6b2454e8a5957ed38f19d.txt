Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity, introduced by John Bollinger in the 1980s.  
Financial traders use Bollinger Bands as a methodical tool to inform trading decisions, control automated trading systems, or as a component of technical analysis.  
Bollinger Bands display a graphical envelope of moving averages and volatility (expressed by the width of the envelope) in a two‑dimensional chart.  
Two user‑chosen input parameters govern how a Bollinger Band chart summarizes historical price data, allowing the response of the chart to vary with the magnitude and frequency of price changes.  
Bollinger Bands consist of an N‑period moving average, an upper band at K times the N‑period standard deviation above the moving average, and a lower band at K times the N‑period standard deviation below the moving average.  
Typical values for the parameters are N = 20 days and K = 2.  
The default average is a simple moving average, but other averages such as exponential moving averages can also be used.  
Usually the same period is used for both the middle band and the calculation of standard deviation.  
Bollinger registered the term “Bollinger Bands” as a U.S. trademark in 2011.  
The purpose of Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low market prices, with prices considered high at the upper band and low at the lower band.  
This definition can aid rigorous pattern recognition and is useful for comparing price action to indicator action to make systematic trading decisions.  
BBImpulse measures price change as a function of the bands; percent bandwidth (%b) normalizes the width of the bands over time; and bandwidth delta quantifies the changing width of the bands.  
Percent b (%b) equals 1 at the upper band and 0 at the lower band, calculated as (last − lowerBB) / (upperBB − lowerBB).  
Bandwidth is calculated as (upperBB − lowerBB) / middleBB.  
With the default parameters of a 20‑period look‑back and ±2 standard deviations, bandwidth equals four times the 20‑period coefficient of variation.
