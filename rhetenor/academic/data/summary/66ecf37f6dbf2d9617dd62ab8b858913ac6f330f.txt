KST = MOV(ROC1,AVG1) × W1 + MOV(ROC2,AVG2) × W2 + MOV(ROC3,AVG3) × W3 + MOV(ROC4,AVG4) × W4.  
MOV(ROC1,AVG1) refers to the AVG1‑day moving average for ROC1.  
For short‑term trends, Martin J. Pring suggests the parameters X1 = 10, X2 = 15, X3 = 20, X4 = 30, AVG1 = 10, AVG2 = 10, AVG3 = 10, AVG4 = 15, W1 = 1, W2 = 2, W3 = 3, W4 = 4.  
The KST formula is built into, or can be included in, technical analysis software packages such as MetaStock or OmniTrader.  
Entry rule: when KST crosses below its 9‑day exponential average, short at the next day’s opening price.  
Exit rule: when KST crosses above its 9‑day exponential average, close the short position at the next day’s opening price.  
KST can be calculated on a daily or long‑term basis.  
The dominant time frame in KST’s construction is a 24‑month period, which is half of the 4‑year business cycle.  
KST works best when the security is experiencing a primary up‑ and downtrend based on the business cycle.  
The moving average used with KST is a simple 10‑day moving average.  
A moving‑average crossover can be anticipated if KST has already turned and price violates a trendline.  
KST can reverse to the downside before an uptrend line is violated.  
When a trendline violation occurs, upside momentum may temporarily dissipate, causing KST to cross below its moving average.  
KST can give false or misleading signals, as illustrated by the April 2005 buy signal.  
Overall, KST is considered more accurate than MACD, which produces more whipsaw signals.
