"The two standard deviations from the mean account for 95.45% of the data; three standard deviations account for 99.73%; and four standard deviations account for 99.994%.",24,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"The two points of the curve that are one standard deviation from the mean are also the inflection points.",18,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"The central limit theorem states that the distribution of an average of many independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward the normal distribution with the probability density function f(x, μ, σ^2) = 1/(σ√(2π)) e^{-½((x-μ)/σ)^2}.",33,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"In that formula, μ is the expected value of the random variables, σ equals their distribution's standard deviation divided by √n, and n is the number of random variables.",28,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"The standard deviation is a scaling variable that adjusts how broad the curve will be, and it also appears in the normalizing constant.",22,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"If a data distribution is approximately normal, then the proportion of data values within z standard deviations of the mean is defined by Proportion = erf(z/√2).",25,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"The error function erf is used in this definition.",8,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"The proportion that is less than or equal to a number x is given by the cumulative distribution function: Proportion ≤ x = ½[1 + erf((x-μ)/(σ√2))] = ½[1 + erf(z/√2)].",30,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"If a data distribution is approximately normal then about 68 percent of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean (μ ± σ).",25,5,5,5,1,1,5,4
"About 95 percent are within two standard deviations (μ ± 2σ).",10,5,5,5,1,1,5,4
"About 99.7 percent lie within three standard deviations (μ ± 3σ).",10,5,5,5,1,1,5,4
"This is known as the 68–95–99.7 rule, or the empirical rule.",10,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"For various values of z, the percentage of values expected to lie in and outside the symmetric interval CI = (−zσ, zσ) are as follows.",24,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
