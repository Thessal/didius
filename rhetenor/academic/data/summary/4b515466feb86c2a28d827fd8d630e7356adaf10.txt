The Dow Jones average chart displayed a five‑wave triangle pattern from November 1928 to April 1942.  
Starting with the second wave, the amplitude of each triangle wave was approximately 61.8 % of the preceding wave.  
The existence of the triangle pattern was confirmed by its generating lines, time relationships, wave structure, and a single coefficient relating each wave to the previous one.  
A high‑speed market breakthrough occurred from 1921 to 1929 and was followed by a wave‑like pattern.  
Wars in 1937‑1939 and the September 1 1939 declaration of war disrupted the market pattern and caused a sharp market rise.

Movements shown on a stock chart in a single sector are rarely a reliable guide to movements in other sectors.
