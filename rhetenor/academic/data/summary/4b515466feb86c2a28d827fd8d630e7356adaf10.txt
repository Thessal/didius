The Dow Jones average chart shows a five-wave triangle from November 1928 to April 1942.  
The amplitude ratio of each triangle wave to the previous one, starting from the second wave, is approximately 61.8%.  
The presence of a triangle pattern is confirmed by its generating lines, time relationships, wave structure, and a single coefficient relating each wave to the previous wave.  
A high-speed market breakthrough occurred from 1921 to 1929, lasting eight years, and was followed by a wave-like pattern.  
Wars in 1937‑1939 and the September 1 1939 declaration of war disrupted the market pattern, causing a sharp market rise and affecting the technical position of the market cycle.  
Figure 83 displays graphs of the London Industrials, the Dow‑Jones Industrials, and U.S. manufacturing output for the period 1928 to January 1943.  
Movement on a chart in only one area of human activity is rarely a reliable guide to other areas.
