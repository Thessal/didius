Over a 10‑day period a 50 % return generated $3,750 profit before a $45 commission, resulting in $3,705 net profit.  
Because soybeans require less margin, three soybean contracts could be traded for each coffee contract, yielding $11,115 profit on soybeans and $9,758.75 profit on coffee.  
The Commodity Selection Index (CSI) value was 348 for soybeans and 318 for coffee.  
The ADXR indicated soybeans were a 9 % better deal than coffee, but the actual difference was 13.9 %.  
Margin requirements cannot be set to maintain a constant relationship with volatility or directional movement.  
There is a direct, though not constant, relationship between margin requirement, volatility, and directional movement.  
The CSI equation continuously analyzes margin, volatility, and directional movement to identify the most advantageous trading situations.  
Margin requirements lag market action; they adjust slowly upward and downward.  
The Commodity Selection Index enables traders to exploit the lag in margin requirements to achieve the best return on invested capital.  
Most technical trading systems are trend‑following, yet most commodities are in a strong trending mode only about 30 % of the time.  
If a trader follows the same commodities or stocks continuously, the system must generate more profit in the 30 % of trending periods than it loses in the 70 % of non‑trending periods.  
Trading only the top five or six commodities on the CSI scale is presented as a more effective approach than trading all commodities or stocks.
