There is a direct but not constant relationship between margin requirement, volatility, and directional movement.  
The CSI equation continuously analyzes margin, volatility, and directional movement to identify the most advantageous situations.  
Margin requirements lag market action; they are slow to increase and slow to decrease.  
The Commodity Selection Index enables traders to exploit the lag in margin requirements to achieve the best return on invested capital.  
Most technical systems are trend‑following, but most commodities are in a strong trending mode only about 30% of the time.  
If a trader follows the same commodities or stocks continuously, the system must generate profits 30% of the time to outweigh losses 70% of the time.  
Trading only the top five or six commodities on the CSI scale is presented as a more effective approach than following all commodities or stocks.
