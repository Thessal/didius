The price of shares is a subject of interest.  
All human activity has three characteristic features—shape (pattern), time, and proportion—each adhering to the Fibonacci numerical sequence.  
The same rules apply to the prices of stocks, bonds, grain, cotton, coffee, and other activities.  
The ideal cycle chart for the stock market is subdivided into a bull market and a bear market.  
A bull market is subdivided into five Primary (Major) waves, while a bear market is subdivided into three Primary (Major) waves.  
In the bull-market chart, each Primary wave [1], [3], and [5] is subdivided into five Intermediate waves.  
Each Intermediate wave 1, 3, and 5 is further subdivided into five Minor waves.  
The bear market is subdivided into three Primary waves labeled [A], [B], and [C].  
In the bear market chart, down-waves [A] and [C] are subdivided into five Intermediate waves.  
The ascending wave [B] in the bear market is subdivided into three Intermediate waves.  
These Intermediate waves are subdivided into five Minor waves.  
A bear market is an inverted bull market, with three Major down-waves versus five Major up-waves in a bull market.  
Corrections in both bullish and bearish areas are the most difficult to study.
