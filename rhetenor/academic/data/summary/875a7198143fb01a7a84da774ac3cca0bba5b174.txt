The price of shares is the subject of interest.  
A cyclical downturn is to be expected in long‑term growth sectors, leading to low prices for both workers and employers.  
Fluctuations in economic well‑being are inevitable.  
All human activity has three characteristic features—shape (pattern), time, and proportion—that each adhere to the Fibonacci numerical sequence.  
The same wave rules that apply to stocks also apply to bonds, grain, cotton, coffee, and other activities.  
The shape (pattern) is the most significant of the three factors in human activity.  
Researchers can often anticipate the appearance of a model based on its predecessor model.  
The ideal cycle chart for the stock market subdivides the market into bull and bear phases.  
In the ideal cycle chart, a bull market is subdivided into five Primary (Major) waves, while a bear market is subdivided into three Primary (Major) waves.  
Each Primary wave [1], [3], and [5] in a bull market is further subdivided into five Intermediate waves.  
Each Intermediate wave 1, 3, and 5 is further subdivided into five Minor waves.  
In a bear market, the three Primary waves are labeled A, B, and C; down‑waves A and C are subdivided into five Intermediate waves, while the up‑wave B is subdivided into three Intermediate waves.  
A bear market is an inverted bull market, differing in that it has three Major down‑waves versus five Major up‑waves in a bull market.  
Corrections in both bullish and bearish markets are the most difficult to study.  
The terms Primary, Intermediate, and Secondary (Minor) refer to wave levels in Elliott wave theory.  
Elliott used the term “Major” as a substitute for “Primary” in later chapters.  
Elliott improved the wave notation introduced in the first monograph.
