Accurate observation of lower‑level waves requires data on the daily range of price changes.  
The publication of high and low values per day (high‑low range) was introduced by Dow and Jones in 1928.  
Chart sizes recommended for highlighting price fluctuations are a quarter inch vertically for one point of the Industrial Average, half an inch vertically for one point of the Rail Average, and half an inch vertically for one point of the Utility Average.  
The quarter‑inch scale is divided into five parts, eliminating guesswork about the exact drawing of daily and hourly bars.  
It is important to maintain the distance between daily bars and not leave extra space for weekends and holidays.  
Exactly the same scale and forms are recommended for hourly charts—a quarter inch of the horizontal axis for a five‑hour session, or one minimum division per hour.  
The daily bar should be plotted at the end of the last hour of each session.  
Timing is the most important factor in investing.  
What to buy is important, but when to buy is even more important.  
Waves show the next market movement based on their models, whose beginning and end are sensitive to accurate and evidence‑based analysis.  
An investment of $1,000 in the stock market in July 1932 would have increased to about $5,000 by March 1937, excluding dividends.
