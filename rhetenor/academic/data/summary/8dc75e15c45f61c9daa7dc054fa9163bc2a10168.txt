In financial applications a simple moving average (SMA) is the unweighted arithmetic mean of the previous k data points.  
The SMA over the last k entries of a data set with n points is calculated as SMAₖ = (1/k) ∑_{i=n‑k+1}^{n} p_i.  
The next SMA can be updated efficiently as SMA_{k,next} = SMA_{k,prev} + (1/k) (p_{n+1} − p_{n‑k+1}).  
This means the moving‑average filter can be computed cheaply on real‑time data with a FIFO/circular buffer using only three arithmetic steps.  
During the initial filling of the FIFO/circular buffer the sampling window equals the data‑set size (k = n), and the average is computed as a cumulative moving average.  
The period selected (k) depends on the type of movement of interest, such as short, intermediate, or long‑term.  
If the data are not centered around the mean, a simple moving average lags behind the latest datum by half the sample width.  
An SMA can be disproportionately influenced by old data dropping out or new data coming in.  
If the data have a periodic fluctuation, applying an SMA with a period equal to that fluctuation eliminates the variation because the average always contains one complete cycle.
