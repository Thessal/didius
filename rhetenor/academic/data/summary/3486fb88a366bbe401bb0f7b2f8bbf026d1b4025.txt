"Mass index is an indicator developed by Donald Dorsey to predict trend reversals.",18,5,5,5,1,2,5,3
"The mass index assumes reversals are more likely when price range widens, comparing previous highs and lows.",27,5,5,5,1,2,5,3
"Mass index is calculated by taking EMA of high-low over 9 days, then EMA of that EMA, and summing their ratio over typically 25 days.",43,5,5,5,1,2,5,3
"Typically the EMA and its double EMA are close, making their ratio about 1 and the sum near 25.",23,4,4,4,1,3,5,3
"According to Dorsey, a reversal bulge is a probable signal of trend reversal regardless of direction.",19,4,4,4,1,1,5,4
"A reversal bulge occurs when the 25‑day mass index reaches 27.0 and then falls below 26 (or 26.5).",20,5,5,5,1,2,5,3
"A 9‑day prime moving average is usually used to decide if the bulge signals a buy or sell.",19,5,5,5,1,2,5,4
"The formula uses intraday range values, not the true range that adjusts for gaps.",17,5,5,5,1,2,5,3
"The bulge does not indicate direction.",7,5,5,5,1,2,5,3
