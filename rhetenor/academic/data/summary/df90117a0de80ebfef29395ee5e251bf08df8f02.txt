The ulcer index is a stock market risk measure or technical analysis indicator devised by Peter Martin in 1987 and published by him and Byron McCann in their 1989 book *The Investors Guide to Fidelity Funds*.  
It measures downwards volatility, specifically the amount of drawdown or retracement over a period.  
Standard deviation treats up‑ and down‑movements equally, but most market traders are long and therefore welcome upward price movement.  
The downside causes stress and the “ulcer” name reflects the ulcer‑causing potential of drawdowns.  
Steve Shellans later used the term ulcer index for a different calculation also based on the ulcer‑causing potential of drawdowns.  
The ulcer index is calculated over a past period of N days by maintaining the highest closing price seen so far and expressing any lower close as a percentage retracement Rᵢ = 100 × (priceᵢ − max price)/max price.  
If the high so far is $5.00, a price of $4.50 represents a retracement of –10%.  
The first R value is always 0 because there is no drawdown from a single price.  
The quadratic mean (root‑mean‑square) of the R values is taken, similar to a standard deviation calculation.  
The ulcer index equals the square root of the sum of the squared R values divided by N: Ulcer = √[(R₁² + R₂² + … + R_N²)/N].  
Because the R values are squared, it does not matter whether they are expressed as positive or negative; both yield a positive ulcer index.
