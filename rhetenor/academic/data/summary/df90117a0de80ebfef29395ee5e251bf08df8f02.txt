The ulcer index is a stock market risk measure or technical analysis indicator devised by Peter Martin in 1987 and published by him and Byron McCann in their 1989 book The Investors Guide to Fidelity Funds.  
It is a measure of downwards volatility, the amount of drawdown or retracement over a period.  
Other volatility measures like standard deviation treat up and down movement equally, but most market traders are long and therefore welcome upward movement in prices.  
The term ulcer index has also been used later by Steve Shellans for a different calculation based on the ulcer‑causing potential of drawdowns.  
The index is based on a given past period of N days.  
Working from oldest to newest, a highest price (highest closing price) seen so far is maintained, and any close below that is a retracement expressed as a percentage: Rᵢ = 100 × (priceᵢ − max price) / max price.  
For example, if the high so far is $5.00 then a price of $4.50 is a retracement of –10%.  
The first R value is always 0 because there is no drawdown from a single price.  
The quadratic mean (or root mean square) of these R values is taken, similar to a standard deviation calculation.  
The ulcer index is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared R values divided by N: Ulcer = √[(R₁² + R₂² + … + R_N²) / N].  
Because the R values are squared, it is immaterial whether they are expressed as positives or negatives; both result in a positive ulcer index.
