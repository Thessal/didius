Williams %R is a technical analysis oscillator showing the current closing price in relation to the high and low of the past N days.  
It was developed by Larry Williams, a publisher and promoter of trading materials.  
Its purpose is to indicate whether a stock or commodity market is trading near the high, near the low, or somewhere in between its recent trading range.  
Williams %R (Percent Range) is a momentum oscillator.  
It represents the price level in relation to the highest point in the previous period.  
The default period for Williams %R is generally set to 14.  
Williams %R can be used to monitor overbought and oversold conditions.  
Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and –100.  
Readings between 0 and –20 are considered overbought, while readings between –80 and –100 are considered oversold.  
Williams %R is a bounded indicator.  
The oscillator is on a negative scale, from –100 (lowest) up to 0 (highest), opposite of the more common 0 to 100 scale.  
A value of –100 means today’s close was the lowest low of the past N days, and 0 means today’s close was the highest high of the past N days.  
Some implementations adjust %R by adding 100.  
The original formula from Williams’s book multiplies the percentage by 100 instead of –100, but many software packages implement it with –100.
