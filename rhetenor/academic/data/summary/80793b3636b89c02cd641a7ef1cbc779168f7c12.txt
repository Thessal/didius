Subset breadth statistics tend to behave homogeneously, with all stocks in a narrow sector moving together up or down.  
In narrow sectors such as gold mining or semiconductor stocks, it is typical for all stocks to rise one day and fall the next.  
Other industry groups and sectors exhibit the same homogeneous behavior to varying degrees.  
Focusing on small groups of stocks causes loss of key indications provided by breadth statistics.  
Examining a diverse collection of stocks can reveal indications not evident from price data alone.  
Breadth statistics provide strong indications about the health of market liquidity.  
A small amount of capital can move a handful of stocks enough to influence major market indices if the right stocks are selected.  
Influencing breadth numbers, which measure all exchange stocks, requires major changes in overall market liquidity.  
To produce positive breadth for several days, available capital must be sufficiently plentiful to be spread across many stocks.  
Measuring acceleration in breadth statistics, as done by the McClellan Oscillator, can give insights into impending price trend direction changes.  
The daily breadth is calculated as advances minus declines (A‑D).  
The McClellan Oscillator uses two exponential moving averages: a 10% Trend EMA and a 5% Trend EMA.  
The 10% Trend EMA is updated as 0.10 × (A‑D) + 0.90 × previous 10% Trend.  
The 5% Trend EMA is updated as 0.05 × (A‑D) + 0.95 × previous 5% Trend.  
The McClellan Oscillator equals the 10% Trend EMA minus the 5% Trend EMA.  
Many technical‑analysis software packages include built‑in modules for calculating the McClellan Oscillator.  
The number of NYSE‑listed stocks changes over time, affecting the amplitude of indicators tied to issue count such as the McClellan Oscillator.  
To remove the effect of changing issue count on the McClellan Oscillator, the daily breadth (A‑D) is divided by the total advances plus declines (A + D) to obtain a ratio.
