Subset breadth statistics tend to behave homogeneously, with all stocks in a narrow sector such as gold mining or semiconductor stocks often moving up together one day and down together the next.  
Narrowing the focus to small groups of stocks causes loss of the key indication provided by breadth statistics.  
Breadth statistics give valuable indications about the health of liquidity available to the stock market.  
A small amount of money can be employed to move a handful of stocks enough to affect major market indices, but affecting breadth numbers, which measure all stocks on the exchange, requires major changes in the liquidity picture.  
The available money must be sufficiently plentiful to be spread widely in order to make the majority of stocks close higher and produce positive breadth for several days.  
Measuring the acceleration in breadth statistics, as done by the McClellan Oscillator, provides important insights about impending trend direction changes for prices.  
The standard McClellan Oscillator is calculated by taking the difference between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of daily breadth: a 10 % Trend EMA and a 5 % Trend EMA.  
Daily breadth is defined as the difference between the number of advances and the number of declines (A − D).  
The 10 % Trend EMA is computed as 0.10 × (A − D) + 0.90 × previous 10 % Trend value.  
The 5 % Trend EMA is computed as 0.05 × (A − D) + 0.95 × previous 5 % Trend value.  
The McClellan Oscillator equals the 10 % Trend EMA minus the 5 % Trend EMA.  
The ratio‑adjusted McClellan Oscillator divides daily breadth (A − D) by the total of advances plus declines (A + D) to obtain a ratio, ignoring unchanged issues.
