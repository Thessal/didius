The Acceleration Factor (AF) starts at 0.02 and increases by 0.02 each day a new high (or new low for short positions) is made, up to a maximum of 0.20.  
SAR for a given day is calculated as SAR_Tomorrow = SAR_Today + AF × (EP − SAR_Today) for long positions (or subtract for short positions).  
EP (Extreme Price) is the extreme high price for a long trade or the extreme low price for a short trade.  
A position is entered when the price penetrates the SAR.  
For the first day of entry, the SAR is the previous Significant Point (SIP): the lowest price reached in the previous short trade for a long entry, or the highest price reached in the previous long trade for a short entry.  
The SAR is never moved into the previous day’s range or today’s range; for long positions, the SAR for tomorrow cannot be above the lower of today’s low and the previous day’s low.  
For short positions, the SAR for tomorrow cannot be below the higher of today’s high and the previous day’s high.  
The system uses an initial AF of 0.02 and increments it by 0.02 each day a new high (or low) is made, never exceeding 0.20.  
In the example, SAR values are computed as follows: SAR6 = 50.17, SAR7 = 50.37, SAR8 = 50.66, SAR9 = 51.04, SAR10 = 51.52, SAR11 = 52.08, SAR12 = 52.71.
