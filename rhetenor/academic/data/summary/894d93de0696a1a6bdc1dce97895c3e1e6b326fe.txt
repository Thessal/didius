The Acceleration Factor (AF) starts at 0.02 and increases by 0.02 each day a new high (or new low for short trades) is made, up to a maximum of 0.20.  
SAR for a given day is calculated as SAR_Today plus AF multiplied by the difference between the extreme price (EP) and SAR_Today.  
The extreme price (EP) is the extreme high price for a long trade or the extreme low price for a short trade.  
A position is entered when the price penetrates the SAR.  
For the first day of entry, the SAR is set to the previous Significant Point (SIP).  
For a long entry, the SIP is the lowest price reached during the previous short trade.  
For a short entry, the SIP is the highest price reached during the previous long trade.  
For subsequent days, SAR is updated using the AF and the difference between the extreme price and the current SAR, without increasing the AF above 0.20.  
The SAR must never be moved into the previous day's range or today's range.  
For long positions, the SAR for tomorrow cannot be above the previous day's low or today's low; if calculated higher, the lower of today’s low and the previous day’s low is used as the new SAR.  
For short positions, the SAR for tomorrow cannot be below the previous day's high or today's high; if calculated lower, the higher of today’s high and the previous day’s high is used as the new SAR.
