Volatility is always accompanied by movement, but movement is not always accompanied by volatility.  
Volatility is also an indicator of movement.  
The most important index to use for a trend‑following system is the Average Directional Movement Index Rating (ADXR).  
Generally the most money is made in the shortest period of time when the stock or commodity is volatile.  
The Commodity Selection Index (CSI) equation incorporates Directional Movement, Volatility, Margin Requirement, and Commission costs, weighted in that order.  
CSI = ADXR × ATR14 × [ V / √M × 1 / (150 + C) ] × 100.  
ADXR stands for Average Directional Movement Index Rating.  
ATR14 is the 14‑day Average True Range.  
V is the value of a 1‑cent move (or the basic increment of the ATR14) expressed in dollars.  
M is the margin requirement in dollars.  
C is the commission in dollars.  
The term 1 / (150 + C) must be carried to four decimal places in the CSI calculation.  
For Soybeans with ADXR = 50, ATR14 = 15 c, M = $3000, C = $45, and V = $50, the CSI calculates to 348.  
For Pork Bellies with ADXR = 37, ATR14 = 1.7 c, M = $1500, C = $60, and V = $360, the CSI calculates to 280.  
Soybeans has a higher CSI rating than Pork Bellies.  
All values inside the brackets of the CSI equation are constant as long as the margin requirement and commission cost do not change.  
A constant K can be defined as K = [ V / √M × 1 / (150 + C) ] × 100, allowing CSI to be calculated as CSI = ADXR × ATR14 × K.  
K needs to be recalculated only when the margin requirement or commission changes.
