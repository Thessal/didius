Volatility is always accompanied by movement, but movement is not always accompanied by volatility.  
Volatility is also an indicator of movement.  
The most important index to use for a trend‑following system is the Average Directional Movement Index Rating (ADXR).  
Generally the most money is made in the shortest period of time when a stock or commodity is volatile.  
The Commodity Selection Index (CSI) equation incorporates Directional Movement, Volatility, Margin Requirement, and Commission costs.  
The CSI equation is: CSI = ADXR × ATR14 × [ V / √M × 1 / (150 + C) ] × 100.  
In the CSI equation, ADXR stands for Average Directional Movement Index Rating.  
In the CSI equation, ATR14 is the 14‑day Average True Range.  
In the CSI equation, V is the value of a 1‑cent move (or the basic increment of the ATR14) expressed in dollars.  
In the CSI equation, M is the margin requirement in dollars.  
In the CSI equation, C is the commission in dollars.  
The term 1 / (150 + C) in the CSI equation must be carried to four decimal places.  
For Soybeans (ADXR = 50, ATR14 = 15 c, M = $3000, C = $45, V = $50), the CSI calculates to 348.  
For Pork Bellies (ADXR = 37, ATR14 = 1.7 c, M = $1500, C = $60, V = $360), the CSI calculates to 280.  
All values inside the brackets of the CSI equation remain constant as long as the margin requirement and commission cost do not change.  
A constant K can be defined to represent the bracketed terms and the factor 100, allowing CSI to be expressed as CSI = ADXR × ATR14 × K.  
K needs to be recalculated only when the margin requirement or commission changes.
