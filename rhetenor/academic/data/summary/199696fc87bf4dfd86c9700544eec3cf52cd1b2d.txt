The plus directional indicator (+DI14) calculated as 8.82/43.32 equals 20, indicating that 20% of the true range for the previous 14 days was up.  
The minus directional indicator (-DI14) calculated as 15.75/43.32 equals 36, indicating that 36% of the true range for the previous 14 days was down.  
The sum of +DI14 and -DI14 is 56%, representing the directional portion of the true range over the past 14 days.  
The remaining 44% of the true range over the past 14 days was non-directional.  
True directional movement is defined as the difference between +DI14 and -DI14.  
In the example, the DI difference (|+DI14 − ‑DI14|) is 16.  
If the price moves up for 14 or more consecutive days, +DI14 becomes large and -DI14 approaches zero, resulting in a large DI difference.  
If the price moves down for 14 or more consecutive days, -DI14 becomes large and +DI14 approaches zero, resulting in a large DI difference.  
If the price moves sideways, the DI difference is very small, indicating non-directional movement.  
Directional movement can be high in a slow-moving market because it is a function of daily range.  
Directional movement can be low in a very volatile market.
