Average True Range (ATR) is a technical analysis volatility indicator originally developed by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. for commodities.  
The ATR indicator does not provide an indication of price trend, only the degree of price volatility.  
The average true range is an N‑period smoothed moving average (SMMA) of the true range values.  
Wilder recommended a 14‑period smoothing for the ATR.  
The true range (TR) for a day is the maximum of (high − low), |high − previous close|, and |low − previous close|.  
The true range can be calculated as TR = max(high, previous close) − min(low, previous close).  
The ATR at time t is calculated using an exponential moving average of the true range values.
