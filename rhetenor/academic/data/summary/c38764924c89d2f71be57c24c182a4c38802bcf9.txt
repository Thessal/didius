"In financial applications a simple moving average (SMA) is the unweighted arithmetic mean of the previous k data-points.",18,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"In science and engineering the mean is normally taken from an equal number of data points on either side of a central value.",22,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"This ensures that variations in the mean are aligned with variations in the data rather than being shifted in time.",21,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"An example of a simple equally weighted running mean is the mean over the last k entries of a data set containing n entries.",23,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"The mean over the last k data-points (days in this example) is denoted as SMA_k and calculated as the sum of the last k points divided by k.",18,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"When calculating the next mean SMA_{k,next} with the same sampling width k, the range from n‑k+2 to n+1 is considered.",24,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"A new value p_{n+1} enters the sum while the oldest value p_{n‑k+1} drops out.",15,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"This simplifies the calculations by reusing the previous mean SMA_{k,prev}.",10,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"The moving average filter can be computed cheaply on real‑time data using a FIFO/circular buffer with only three arithmetic steps.",24,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"During the initial filling of the FIFO/circular buffer the sampling window equals the data‑set size (k = n) and the average is computed as a cumulative moving average.",34,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"The selected period k depends on the type of movement of interest, such as short, intermediate, or long‑term.",18,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"If the data are not centered around the mean, a simple moving average lags behind the latest datum by half the sample width.",24,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"An SMA can be disproportionately influenced by old data dropping out or new data coming in.",17,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"One characteristic of the SMA is that if the data have a periodic fluctuation, applying an SMA of that period eliminates that variation because the average always contains one complete cycle.",32,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
