"The ulcer index was created by Peter Martin in 1987 and published with Byron McCann in 1989.",36,5,1,5,1,1,5,4
"It measures downwards volatility as the amount of drawdown or retracement over a period.",16,5,1,5,1,5,5,4

"The index is based on a given past period of N days.",12,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"The method maintains the highest price seen so far and treats any lower close as a percentage retracement.",28,5,1,5,1,5,5,4

"The first R is always 0 because there is no drawdown from a single price.",14,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"The quadratic mean (root mean square) of these values is taken, similar to a standard deviation calculation.",18,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"Since R values are squared, it does not matter if they are positive or negative; both give a positive Ulcer Index.",24,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
