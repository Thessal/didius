"The McClellan Oscillator and Summation Index are early technical indicators used to interpret the Advance-Decline Line.",29,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"The indicators were created in 1969 by Sherman and Marian McClellan.",18,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"Tom explains the origin of the McClellan Oscillator and its importance for market analysis.",27,4,2,4,1,2,5,5
"The Oscillator measures acceleration in daily A-D statistics using two exponential moving averages and their difference.",31,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"The tool became well known among analysts, first in Southern California and later nationwide as its reputation spread.",30,4,1,4,1,2,5,5
"Colonel Leonard Ayres first analyzed Advance-Decline data in 1926 while at Cleveland Trust Company.",24,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"He sought an alternative market view beyond individual stock prices or averages like the DJIA.",28,4,2,4,1,3,5,5
"He shared his work with analysts like James Hughes, who pioneered market breadth statistics.",19,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"Barron's began publishing Advance-Decline numbers in 1931.",12,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"The primary long-term use of A-D data was building a cumulative A-D Line.",17,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"A cumulative A-D Line is calculated by summing daily breadth, the net advancing minus declining issues each day.",29,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"Each trading day, the A-D Line moves by the daily breadth value.",16,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"A drawback is that varying traded issue counts can alter A-D Line amplitude, especially over long periods.",35,4,2,4,1,2,5,5
"A solution is to use a ratio rather than raw A-D values.",17,4,2,4,1,2,5,5
"Analysts compute the ratio by dividing daily A-D difference by total advances plus declines, removing issue count effects.",30,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
"Data usage only spread in the early 1960s after being publicized by Richard Russell and Joseph Granville.",34,4,2,4,1,2,5,5
"Its popularity stemmed from the A-D Line accurately signaling a divergent top before a 27% DJIA decline in 1961.",42,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
