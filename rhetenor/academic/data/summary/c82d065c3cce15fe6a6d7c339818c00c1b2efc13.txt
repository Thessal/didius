Parabolic SAR is a method devised by J. Welles Wilder Jr. to find potential reversals in the market price direction of traded goods such as securities or currency exchanges.  
Parabolic SAR is a trend‑following (lagging) indicator that may be used to set a trailing stop loss or determine entry or exit points.  
The indicator generally works only in trending markets and creates whipsaws during ranging or sideways phases.  
Wilder recommends first establishing the direction or change in direction of the trend through the use of parabolic SAR, and then using a different indicator such as the Average Directional Index to determine the strength of the trend.  
A parabola below the price is generally bullish, while a parabola above the price is generally bearish.  
A parabola below the price may be used as support, whereas a parabola above the price may represent resistance.  
When the price is in an uptrend, the SAR emerges below the price and converges upwards towards it; when in a downtrend, the SAR emerges above the price and converges downwards.  
At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated one period in advance using data available today.  
The SAR next‑period value is calculated as SARₙ₊₁ = SARₙ + α (EP − SARₙ).  
EP (extreme point) records the highest price reached during an uptrend or the lowest price during a downtrend and is updated when a new maximum or minimum is observed.  
The acceleration factor α is usually set initially to 0.02 and is increased by 0.02 each time a new EP is recorded.
