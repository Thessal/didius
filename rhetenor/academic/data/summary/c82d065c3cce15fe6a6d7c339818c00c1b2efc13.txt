Parabolic SAR is a method devised by J. Welles Wilder Jr. to find potential reversals in the market price direction of traded goods such as securities or currency exchanges.  
It is a trend‑following (lagging) indicator that may be used to set a trailing stop loss or determine entry or exit points during strong trends.  
The indicator generally works only in trending markets and creates “whipsaws” during ranging or sideways phases.  
Wilder recommends first establishing the direction or change in direction of the trend with parabolic SAR, then using another indicator such as the Average Directional Index to determine trend strength.  
A parabola below the price is generally bullish, while a parabola above the price is generally bearish.  
A parabola below the price may be used as support, whereas a parabola above the price may represent resistance.  
When the price is in an uptrend, the SAR appears below the price and converges upward toward it.  
When the price is in a downtrend, the SAR appears above the price and converges downward.  
At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated one period in advance, using only data available today to compute tomorrow’s SAR value.  
The general formula for SAR is SARₙ₊₁ = SARₙ + α (EP − SARₙ).  
EP (extreme point) records the highest price reached during an uptrend or the lowest price during a downtrend and is updated whenever a new maximum or minimum is observed.  
The acceleration factor α is usually set initially to 0.02 but can be chosen by the trader.  
The acceleration factor is increased by 0.02 each time a new extreme point is recorded.
