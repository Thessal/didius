"A pivot point is a price level used by traders as a market movement indicator.",22,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"A pivot point is calculated as the average of high, low, and close prices from the prior trading period.",25,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Trading above the pivot point suggests bullish sentiment; trading below suggests bearish.",30,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Pivot points and their support/resistance levels often act as turning points for price direction.",23,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"In uptrends, pivot points and resistance may act as price ceilings that can trigger reversals.",31,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"In downtrends, pivot points and support may form a stable low price level resisting further decline.",25,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Multiple methods exist to calculate a market's pivot point.",12,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Typically, the pivot point is the arithmetic mean of high, low, and close prices from the prior period.",25,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Pivot point equals (H + L + C) divided by 3.",10,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Sometimes the average includes the opening price of the previous or current period.",15,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Pivot point equals (O + H + L + C) divided by 4.",12,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Traders may weight the closing price twice or the opening price twice in the pivot calculation.",36,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Technical analysts define a Central Pivot Range (CPR) using levels above and below the pivot point.",25,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"They prefer considering a range rather than a single pivot level.",16,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"The lower boundary, BC (Bottom Central), is calculated as follows.",16,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"BC equals (H + L) divided by 2.",7,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"The upper boundary, TC (Top Central), is calculated as follows.",16,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"TC equals (P minus BC) plus P.",7,5,4,3,1,1,5,3

"Pivot point analysis typically recognizes three levels above and below the pivot point.",17,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Levels are computed by adding or subtracting the prior period's price range to/from the pivot point.",28,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"Support S1 and resistance R1 are derived from the upper and lower halves of the prior range.",45,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"First resistance adds the lower prior range width to the pivot; first support subtracts the upper width.",47,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"R1 equals P plus (P minus L), i.e., 2P minus L.",11,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
"S1 equals P minus (H minus ...).",6,5,4,3,1,1,5,3
