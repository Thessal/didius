"Morgan coined the name 'McClellan Oscillator' to refer to the indicator created by the McClellans, which became a daily feature on Morgan's TV show.",25,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
"The invitation onto the show led to an introduction to Pete Haurlan, who invited Sherman and Marian McClellan to further publish their work.",23,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
"The booklet Patterns For Profit resulted from this work and was originally published by Trade Levels in 1970.",20,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
"It included charts with eight years of history of the McClellan Oscillator and Summation Index, all manually calculated by Marian and hand-plotted.",22,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
"Continued exposure on KWHY-TV and seminars helped the indicators quickly gain appreciation among technically inclined investors in Los Angeles, and the word slowly spread across the United States.",32,4,3,4,1,3,5,4
"It gained a wider following in the 1980s after personal computers, when early analysis programs like Computrac featured the McClellan Oscillator and Summation Index among their technical tool packages.",35,4,3,4,1,3,5,4
"The McClellans slightly updated their book in 1989, adding text reflecting that calculations could now be done with personal computers.",23,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
"McClellan Financial Publications still sells reprints of this edition along with chart history of the McClellan Oscillator and Summation Index from 1960 onward.",23,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
"Examining the chart pattern will provide much more information about what the Oscillator has to tell us.",18,4,3,4,1,3,5,4
"Certain chart structures and behavior can be enormously revealing.",9,3,4,3,1,3,5,4
"When the Oscillator's movements diverge from price action, it can signal an impending change in price direction.",21,4,4,4,1,3,5,4
"The Oscillator serves as an accelerometer for market breadth statistics.",11,4,3,4,1,3,5,3
"A rocket fired into the sky decelerates before reversing direction and falling back to earth, analogous to typical stock price behavior.",33,3,4,3,1,2,5,3
"Measuring acceleration can help signal an impending change in trend direction.",14,4,3,4,1,3,5,4
"The chart below shows several divergences between NYSE Composite Index price action and the McClellan Oscillator.",19,5,2,5,1,5,5,3
"These divergences occur more often at tops than at bottoms, partly because the US market tends to have rounded tops and spike bottoms.",35,4,4,4,1,3,5,4
"This does not mean divergent bottoms cannot be found, only that divergent tops are seen more frequently.",21,4,4,4,1,3,5,4
"A congestion occurs when the Oscillator fluctuates by very small increments over several days.",14,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
"One or two days of small changes is not enough; a sustained period is required.",17,4,3,4,1,3,5,3
"The Oscillator area where congestion occurs is called a 'congestion zone' and usually forms above the zero line.",21,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
"We seldom see them form at extended negative values.",9,4,3,4,1,3,5,3
"Sherman was the only one to respond.",7,5,2,5,1,4,5,3
