The 7‑day average (avg₇) is calculated as the sum of the buying pressure values for the last 7 days divided by the sum of the true range values for the last 7 days: avg₇ = (bp₁+…+bp₇)/(tr₁+…+tr₇).  
The same average calculation is performed for the past 14 days (avg₁₄) and past 28 days (avg₂₈).  
The Ultimate Oscillator combines the three averages in the proportion 4:2:1, scales the result by 100, and yields a value between 0 and 100.  
The formula for the Ultimate Oscillator is: Ultimate Oscillator = 100 × (4·avg₇ + 2·avg₁₄ + avg₂₈) / (4+2+1).  
According to Larry Williams, a bullish buy signal occurs when price makes new lows while the oscillator does not, indicating bullish divergence, and the oscillator has fallen below 30 during the divergence.  
The bullish buy signal is confirmed when the oscillator rises above the high reached between the two price lows, and the trigger is the rise through that high.  
A bullish position is closed when the oscillator rises above 70 (overbought) or rises above 50 and then falls back through 45.  
A bearish sell signal is generated when the oscillator shows divergence above level 70, and the position is closed when the oscillator falls below 30 (oversold).
