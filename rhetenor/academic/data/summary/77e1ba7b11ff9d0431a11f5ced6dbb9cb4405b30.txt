The Parabolic Time/Price System is named because the charted pattern of its stops resembles a parabola or French curve.  
The system allows the market to react for the first few days after a trade is initiated before the stop begins to move more rapidly.  
In the Parabolic Time/Price System, the stop is a function of both price and time.  
The stop never backs up; it moves an incremental amount each day only in the direction of the trade.  
For a long position, the stop moves up every day regardless of the price direction, representing the time function.  
The stop’s price component moves proportionally to the most favorable price reached since the trade was initiated.  
If the price move does not materialize or reverses, the stop reverses the position and a new time period begins.  
By the 10th day, the stop stops accelerating and becomes a function of price only.  
The stop for the first day of a trade is the SIP, defined as the extreme price point reached in the previous trade.  
The system is a true reversal system where every stop point is also a reverse point, called a SAR (Stop and Reverse).  
The SAR for a given day is calculated as SAR_today = SAR_previous + AF × (High_previous – SAR_previous).  
The acceleration factor (AF) starts at 0.02, increases by 0.02 each day a new high is made, and is capped at 0.20.  
In the example where a new high occurs each day, the AF increases by 0.02 each day.
