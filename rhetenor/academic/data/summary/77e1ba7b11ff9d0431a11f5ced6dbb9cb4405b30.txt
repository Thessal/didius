The Parabolic Time/Price System is named because the pattern formed by its stops resembles a parabola or French curve when charted.  
The system allows the market to react for the first few days after a trade is initiated before the stop begins to move more rapidly.  
The stop is a function of both price and time and never backs up; it moves an incremental amount each day only in the direction of the trade.  
For a long position, the stop moves up every day regardless of the direction the price is moving, representing the time function.  
The stop distance moves up relative to the most favorable price reached since the trade was initiated, representing the price function.  
If the anticipated price move does not materialize or moves opposite, the stop reverses the position and a new time period begins.  
By the 10th day, the stop ceases accelerating and becomes a function of price only.  
The stop for the first day of a trade is the SIP, defined as the extreme price point reached in the previous trade.  
Each stop point is also a reverse point, called a SAR (Stop and Reverse).  
The SAR for a given day is calculated as SARₙ = SARₙ₋₁ + AF × (Hₙ₋₁ − SARₙ₋₁), where H is the highest price of the previous day.  
The acceleration factor (AF) starts at 0.02 and can increase up to 0.20, rising by 0.02 each day a new high is made.
