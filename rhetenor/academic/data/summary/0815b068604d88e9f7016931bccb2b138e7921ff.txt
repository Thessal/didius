The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an indicator designed to address scaling, data volume, and comparability problems across commodities.  
The RSI formula is RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS).  
The initial RSI calculation requires the previous 14 days' closing prices.  
Subsequent RSI calculations require only the previous day's data.  
The average UP close is computed by summing the up closes over the previous 14 days and dividing by 14.  
The average DOWN close is computed by summing the down closes over the previous 14 days and dividing by 14.  
Relative Strength (RS) is the ratio of the average UP close to the average DOWN close.  
The RSI is obtained by subtracting 100 divided by (1 plus RS) from 100.  
For each new day, the next average UP close is calculated as (previous average UP close * 13 + today's UP close) / 14.  
For each new day, the next average DOWN close is calculated as (previous average DOWN close * 13 + today's DOWN close) / 14.  
A ten‑column worksheet can be used to track daily RSI calculations.  
In the worksheet, column 1 records the date, column 2 the daily close price, column 3 the amount the price closed up from the previous day (recorded only if up), column 4 the amount the price closed down from the previous day (recorded only if down), column 5 the average UP close, and column 6 the average DOWN close.
