The Relative Strength Index (RSI) solves the problems of scale, data volume, and comparability across commodities by providing a common denominator oscillator.
The RSI is calculated with the formula: RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS).
The first RSI calculation requires the previous 14 days' closing prices.
Subsequent RSI calculations require only the previous day's data.
The average UP close is computed by summing the UP closes over the previous 14 days and dividing by 14.
The average DOWN close is computed by summing the DOWN closes over the previous 14 days and dividing by 14.
Relative Strength (RS) is the ratio of the average UP close to the average DOWN close.
To compute RSI, add 1.00 to RS, divide 100 by this sum, and subtract the result from 100.
For later periods, the next average UP close is (previous average UP close * 13 + today's UP close) / 14.
For later periods, the next average DOWN close is (previous average DOWN close * 13 + today's DOWN close) / 14.
Steps of dividing RS, adding 1, and applying the RSI formula remain the same after the initial calculation.
A ten‑column worksheet can be used to track daily RSI data.
Column 1 of the worksheet records the date.
Column 2 records the day's closing price.
Column 3 records the amount the price closed up from the previous day, entered only if the price closed up.
Column 4 records the amount the price closed down from the previous day, entered only if the price closed down.
Column 5 records the average UP close value.
Column 6 records the average DOWN close value.
