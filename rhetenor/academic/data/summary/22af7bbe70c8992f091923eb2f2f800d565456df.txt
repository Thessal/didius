Because the R values are squared it does not matter whether they are expressed as positives or negatives; both result in a positive Ulcer Index.  
The Ulcer Index calculation is relatively immune to the sampling rate used and gives similar results when calculated on weekly prices as on daily prices.  
Martin advises against sampling less often than weekly because with quarterly prices a fall and recovery could occur entirely within a period and thereby not affect the index.  
Martin recommends his Ulcer Index as a measure of risk in contexts where the standard deviation is usually used.  
The Ulcer Index can replace the standard deviation to create an Ulcer Performance Index (UPI) or Martin ratio.  
In both the Sharpe ratio and the UPI, annualized rates of return are used (net of costs, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, etc.).  
The Ulcer Index can be charted over time and used as a technical analysis indicator to show stocks entering ulcer‑forming territory or to compare volatility across different stocks.  
As with the Sharpe ratio, a higher value of the UPI is better than a lower value because investors prefer more return for less risk.
