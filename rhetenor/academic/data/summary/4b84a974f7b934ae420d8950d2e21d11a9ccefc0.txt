Directional movement can be expressed as an absolute mathematical equation.  
Directional movement can be rated on a scale of zero to one hundred for any commodity or stock.  
When using a trend‑following method, traders would select only those commodities that rank in the upper end of the directional movement scale.  
When using a system that profits from choppy or non‑trending markets, traders would select only those commodities that rank in the lower end of the directional movement scale.  
The smallest upward directional movement (+DM) is defined as today’s high minus yesterday’s high.  
The smallest downward directional movement (‑DM) is defined as today’s low minus yesterday’s low.  
On an outside day, directional movement is determined by the larger of +DM and ‑DM, and the smaller value is ignored.  
On an inside day, directional movement is zero.  
On a limit‑up day, +DM equals the current high minus the previous high.  
On a limit‑down day, ‑DM equals the current low minus the previous low.  
An equilibrium point can be defined where upward directional movement equals downward directional movement.
