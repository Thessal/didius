The interaction between price movement and oscillator movement can be illustrated by taking a straight‑line price relationship and plotting oscillator points based on that relationship.  
Using a ten‑day oscillator, the oscillator value for a given day is calculated as today’s closing price minus the closing price ten days earlier.  
An oscillator value of –2.25 is plotted below the zero line.  
By calculating the oscillator value each day, an oscillator curve is developed.  
When the price moves down by the same increment each day, the oscillator curve becomes a horizontal line.  
If the price turns up by 25 points while the oscillator turns up by 50 points, the oscillator is increasing twice as fast as the price.  
The oscillator can continue to increase at a constant rate even while the price continues to move up at the same rate, eventually reaching a constant oscillator value.  
When the price levels out, the oscillator can begin to decline even though the price remains horizontal.  
If the price remains horizontal, the oscillator will continue to descend until both the oscillator and the price are moving horizontally after ten days.  
The oscillator appears to be one step ahead of the price because it measures the rate of change of price movement.  
Between days when the price direction changes from down to up, the oscillator shows a very fast price rate of change.  
Once the price ten days ago has bottomed out and started to rise, the rate of change slows because subsequent increments are measured in only one direction.  
The oscillator can be an excellent technical tool for traders who understand its characteristics, but three problems are encountered in developing a meaningful oscillator.  
The first problem is erratic movement within the oscillator configuration, which can produce erroneously high oscillator values when recent price changes are small compared to price ten days earlier.  
To overcome the first problem, the extreme points used to calculate the oscillator must be dampened or smoothed.  
The second problem is determining an appropriate Y‑axis scale for the oscillator, which varies across different commodities.  
To overcome the second problem, a common denominator should be applied to all commodities so that the oscillator’s amplitude is relative and meaningful.
