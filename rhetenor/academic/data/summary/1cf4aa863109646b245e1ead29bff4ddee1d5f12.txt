The interaction between price movement and oscillator movement can be illustrated by taking a straight-line price relationship and plotting oscillator points based on that relationship.  
Using a ten‑day oscillator, the oscillator value on a given day is calculated as today’s closing price minus the closing price ten days earlier (e.g., 48.50 − 50.75 = ‑2.25).  
An oscillator value of –2.25 is plotted below the zero line.  
When price declines by the same amount each day, the oscillator curve becomes a horizontal line.  
If price rises by 25 points while the oscillator rises by 50 points, the oscillator is increasing twice as fast as the price.  
The oscillator can remain constant even while price continues to rise at the same rate.  
When price levels out, the oscillator may begin to decline.  
If price moves horizontally, the oscillator will continue to descend until both become horizontal after ten days.  
The oscillator appears to be one step ahead of price because it measures the rate of change of price movement.  
Between days 14 and 23 the oscillator indicates a very fast price rate of change due to a reversal from down to up.  
Once the price ten days ago has bottomed out and started to rise, the rate of change slows because increments are measured in one direction only.  
The oscillator can be an excellent technical tool for traders who understand its characteristics, but three problems arise in developing a meaningful oscillator.  
The first problem is erratic movement caused by extreme price changes ten days apart, which can produce erroneously high oscillator values.  
To overcome the first problem, the oscillator calculation should include a method to dampen or smooth extreme points.  
The second problem is determining an appropriate Y‑axis scale, which varies across commodities.  
To overcome the second problem, a common denominator should be applied to all commodities so that oscillator amplitude is relative and meaningful.
