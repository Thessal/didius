"The standard deviation s equals 0.6 times the range R.",6,5,1,1,1,5,5,5
"For N>100 approximately normal data, the range rule estimates s ≈ R/4 because 95% of the normal distribution spans about four standard deviations.",60,4,5,4,1,2,5,5
"The range rule aids sample size estimation because ranges are easier to estimate than standard deviations.",24,4,4,2,1,2,5,4
"Alternative divisors K(N) provide s ≈ R/K(N) for different N and non‑normal distributions.",22,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
