The Money Flow Index (MFI) is an oscillator that ranges from 0 to 100.  
The MFI is used to show the money flow (an approximation of the dollar value of a day's trading) over several days.  
The typical price for each day is the average of the high price, the low price and the closing price.  
Money flow for a certain day is typical price multiplied by volume on that day.  
Positive money flow is calculated by adding the money flow of all the days where the typical price is higher than the previous day's typical price.  
Negative money flow is calculated by adding the money flow of all the days where the typical price is lower than the previous day's typical price.  
If the typical price is unchanged then that day is discarded from the calculation of positive or negative money flow.  
The money ratio is the ratio of positive money flow to negative money flow.  
The Money Flow Index is calculated from the money ratio.
