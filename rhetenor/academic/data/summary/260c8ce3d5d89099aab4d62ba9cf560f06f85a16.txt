Money flow ratio is defined as positive money flow divided by negative money flow.  
The Money Flow Index (MFI) is calculated as MFI = 100 − (100 / (1 + money ratio)).  
The Money Flow Index can also be expressed as MFI = 100 × (positive money flow / (positive money flow + negative money flow)).  
The MFI represents the percentage of positive money flow relative to total money flow.  
MFI is used to measure the “enthusiasm” of the market.  
MFI shows how much a stock was traded.  
An MFI value of 80 or higher is generally considered overbought.  
An MFI value of 20 or lower is generally considered oversold.  
Divergences between MFI and price action are considered significant; for example, if price makes a new rally high but the MFI high is lower than its previous high, this may indicate a weak advance likely to reverse.  
MFI is constructed similarly to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), both comparing up days to total up and down days, but MFI uses volume (or dollar‑volume approximation) while RSI uses price‑change amounts.  
Marek and Čadková (2020) studied different settings of MFI parameters, with testing randomized across time and companies.
