Money flow index (MFI) is defined as MFI = 100 − (100 / (1 + money ratio)), where money ratio = positive money flow / negative money flow.  
MFI can also be expressed as MFI = 100 × (positive money flow / (positive money flow + negative money flow)).  
MFI represents the percentage of positive money flow relative to total money flow.  
MFI is used to measure the “enthusiasm” of the market.  
MFI shows how much a stock was traded.  
A MFI value of 80 or more is generally considered overbought.  
A MFI value of 20 or less is generally considered oversold.  
Divergences between MFI and price action are considered significant; for example, if price makes a new rally high but the MFI high is lower than its previous high, this may indicate a weak advance likely to reverse.  
MFI is constructed in a similar fashion to the relative strength index (RSI); both compare up days against total up and down days, but MFI uses volume (or dollar‑volume approximation) while RSI uses price‑change amounts.  
Marek and Čadková (2020) studied different settings of MFI parameters, using testing that was randomized in time and across companies.
