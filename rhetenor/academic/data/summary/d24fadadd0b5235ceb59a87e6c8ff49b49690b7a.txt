Significant positive returns on buy trades generated by the contrarian moving‑average crossover rule, the channel breakout rule, and the Bollinger Band trading rule were observed after accounting for transaction costs of 0.50 percent.  
Bollinger Band trading strategies combined with the ADX have produced similar positive results for equity market indices.  
Butler et al. (2012) showed that fitting Bollinger Band parameters with particle‑swarm optimization and tuning them to a specific asset and market environment improves out‑of‑sample trading signals compared with using default parameters.  
Security price returns exhibit fat tails relative to a normal distribution.  
A sample size of 20 observations is too small for reliable conclusions from statistical techniques that rely on the central limit theorem.  
Security price time series are serially correlated and therefore are not independent and identically distributed.  
Moving standard deviations, which use deviations from a moving average, are intended to adjust for serial correlation, but higher‑order price autocorrelation may remain unaccounted for.  
Empirical studies have found that only about 88 % (approximately 85–90 %) of security prices remain within Bollinger Bands, rather than the 95 % expected under a normal distribution.  
Practitioners also use related measures such as Keltner channels or Stoller average range channels, which base band widths on price volatility measures like the daily high‑low price difference instead of standard deviation.
