Significant positive returns on buy trades generated by the contrarian moving‑average crossover rule, the channel breakout rule, and the Bollinger Band trading rule were observed in the Chinese market after accounting for transaction costs of 0.50 percent.  
Bollinger Band trading strategies combined with the ADX have produced similar positive results for equity‑market indices.  
Fitting Bollinger‑Band parameters with a particle‑swarm‑optimization method improves out‑of‑sample trading signals compared with using the default parameters.  
Security‑price returns exhibit fat tails relative to a normal distribution and have no known statistical distribution.  
A typical sample size of 20 observations is too small for reliable conclusions from central‑limit‑theorem‑based statistical techniques applied to security‑price series.  
Security‑price series are serially correlated, violating the independent‑and‑identically‑distributed assumption required by many statistical methods.  
Only about 88 % (approximately 85 %–90 %) of security prices remain within Bollinger Bands, contrary to the 95 % expected under normal‑distribution assumptions.  
Practitioners also use Keltner channels or Stoller average‑range channels, which base band widths on measures such as the daily high‑low price range rather than on standard deviation.
