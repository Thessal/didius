Haurlan's pamphlet "Measuring Trend Values" describes techniques for calculating and interpreting exponential moving averages (EMAs).  
The smoothing constant for an EMA is calculated as 2 divided by (n + 1), where n is the number of days.  
A 19‑day EMA corresponds to a 10 % trend, giving a smoothing constant of 0.10.  
In a simple moving average (SMA), only data within the specified look‑back period affect the average; data beyond that period have no influence.  
In an exponential moving average (EMA), all past data remain in the calculation but their influence diminishes over time.  
Haurlan founded the Trade Levels Report newsletter, which featured computer‑aided technical analysis of stocks.  
Sherman and Marian McClellan enhanced EMA analysis by calculating the difference between a 10 % trend EMA and a 5 % trend EMA of daily breadth figures.  
The difference‑of‑EMAs method used by the McClellans is mathematically similar to the Moving Average Convergence‑Divergence (MACD) technique developed by Gerald Appel, though MACD typically uses simple moving averages.  
The McClellan Oscillator was created by Sherman and Marian McClellan as a stock‑market breadth indicator.
