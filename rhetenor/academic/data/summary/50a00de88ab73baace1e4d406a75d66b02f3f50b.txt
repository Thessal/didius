The smoothing constant for an exponential moving average (EMA) is calculated as 2 divided by (n + 1), where n is the number of days.  
A 19‑day EMA corresponds to a 10 % smoothing constant because 2 / (19 + 1) = 0.10.  
In a simple moving average (SMA), only data within the specified lookback period influence the average’s value.  
In an EMA, all past data remain in the calculation but their influence diminishes over time.  
Haurlan’s Trade Levels Report newsletter featured computer‑aided technical analysis and sponsored the “Charting The Market” end‑of‑day chart program.  
By 1969 Haurlan was using EMAs to analyze market breadth data.  
Sherman and Marian McClellan calculated the difference between two EMAs of daily breadth figures—a 10 % trend EMA and a 5 % trend EMA—to obtain a distinct view.  
The difference between two EMAs of breadth data is mathematically similar to the Moving Average Convergence‑Divergence (MACD) technique, though MACD typically uses simple moving averages.  
The McClellan Oscillator was developed by Sherman and Marian McClellan.
