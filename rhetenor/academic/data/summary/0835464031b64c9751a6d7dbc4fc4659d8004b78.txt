The Know Sure Thing (KST) oscillator is a complex, smoothed price velocity indicator developed by Martin J. Pring.  
A rate of change (ROC) indicator is the foundation of the KST indicator.  
The KST indicator is useful for identifying major stock market cycle junctures because its formula is weighted toward longer and more dominant time spans to better reflect primary swings of the stock market cycle.  
The concept behind the KST oscillator is that price trends are determined by the interaction of many different time cycles and that important trend reversals occur when several price trends change direction simultaneously.  
ROC1 is calculated as (Price / Price(X1) – 1) × 100.  
ROC2 is calculated as (Price / Price(X2) – 1) × 100.  
ROC3 is calculated as (Price / Price(X3) – 1) × 100.  
ROC4 is calculated as (Price / Price(X4) – 1) × 100.  
In the ROC formulas, “price” refers to the current closing price and “price(Xi)” refers to the closing price Xi bars ago.  
The KST value is the sum of weighted moving averages of the four ROC values: KST = MOV(ROC1, AVG1) × W1 + MOV(ROC2, AVG2) × W2 + MOV(ROC3, AVG3) × W3 + MOV(ROC4, AVG4) × W4.
