The acceleration factor for the Parabolic SAR is initially set to 0.02 but can be chosen by the trader.  
The acceleration factor is increased by 0.02 each time a new extreme point (EP) is recorded.  
The maximum value for the acceleration factor is normally set to 0.20 to prevent it from getting too large.  
For stock trading, it is preferable to set the acceleration factor to 0.01 so that it is not too sensitive to local decreases.  
For commodity or currency trading, the preferred acceleration factor value is 0.02.  
If the next period's SAR value falls inside or beyond the current period's price range, the SAR must be set to the closest price bound.  
If the next period's SAR value falls inside or beyond the next period's price range, a new trend direction is signaled and the SAR switches sides.  
Upon a trend switch, the first SAR value for the new trend is set to the last extreme point recorded on the prior trend, the extreme point is reset to the period's maximum, and the acceleration factor is reset to its initial value of 0.02.  
A modern study backtesting the Parabolic SAR on 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks over a 12‑year period to 2023 found a 19% win rate when using PSAR with a standard OHLC chart.  
The same study found a 63% success rate when using PSAR with a Heikin Ashi chart.
