The acceleration factor in the Parabolic SAR is initially set to 0.02 but can be chosen by the trader.  
The acceleration factor is increased by 0.02 each time a new extreme point (EP) is recorded.  
A maximum value for the acceleration factor is normally set to 0.20 to prevent it from getting too large.  
For stock trading, it is preferable to set the acceleration factor to 0.01 to avoid excessive sensitivity to local decreases.  
For commodity or currency trading, the preferred acceleration factor value is 0.02.  
If the next period's SAR value falls inside or beyond the current period's price range, the SAR must be set to the closest price bound.  
If the next period's SAR value falls inside or beyond the next period's price range, a new trend direction is signaled and the SAR switches sides.  
Upon a trend switch, the first SAR value for the new trend is set to the last extreme point recorded on the prior trend, the EP is reset to the period's maximum, and the acceleration factor is reset to its initial value of 0.02.  
A modern study of the Parabolic SAR based on 2,880 years of backtesting over a 12‑year period to 2023 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average 30 stocks showed a 19% win rate when using PSAR with a standard OHLC chart.  
Using PSAR with a Heikin Ashi chart produced a 63% success rate on the same dataset.
