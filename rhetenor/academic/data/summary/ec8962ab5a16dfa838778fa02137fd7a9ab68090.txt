The average directional movement index (ADX) was developed in 1978 by J. Welles Wilder as an indicator of trend strength in a series of prices of a financial instrument.  
ADX has become a widely used indicator for technical analysts and is provided as a standard in collections of indicators offered by various trading platforms.  
The ADX is a combination of the positive directional indicator (+DI) and the negative directional indicator (‑DI) and smooths the result with a smoothed moving average.  
To calculate +DI and ‑DI, price data consisting of high, low, and closing prices each period (typically each day) is needed.  
UpMove is calculated as today’s high minus yesterday’s high; DownMove is yesterday’s low minus today’s low.  
If UpMove > DownMove and UpMove > 0, then +DM = UpMove, else +DM = 0.  
If DownMove > UpMove and DownMove > 0, then ‑DM = DownMove, else ‑DM = 0.  
+DI = 100 × (smoothed moving average of +DM) ÷ average true range.  
‑DI = 100 × (smoothed moving average of ‑DM) ÷ average true range.  
ADX = 100 × (smoothed moving average of |+DI − ‑DI|) ÷ (+DI + ‑DI).  
Variations of the ADX calculation typically involve using different types of moving averages, such as exponential, weighted, or adaptive moving averages.  
ADX does not indicate trend direction or momentum, only trend strength.  
ADX is a lagging indicator; a trend must have established itself before ADX generates a signal that a trend is underway.  
ADX values range between 0 and 100.  
ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness.  
ADX readings above 40 indicate trend strength.  
ADX readings above 50 indicate an extremely strong trend.  
ADX has been shown to be a reliable coincident indicator of classical chart‑pattern development, with readings below 20 occurring just prior to pattern breakouts.  
The value of ADX is proportional to the slope of the trend.  
The slope of the ADX line is proportional to the acceleration of the price movement (changing trend slope).  
If the trend has a constant slope, the ADX value tends to flatten out.  
One market‑timing method uses ADX turning up when it is below both directional lines and +DI is above ‑DI as a buy signal, and selling when ADX turns back down, as described by Alexander Elder.
