Low_N is the lowest price over the last N periods.  
High_N is the highest price over the last N periods.  
% D is a 3‑period simple moving average of % K.  
% D‑Slow is a 3‑period simple moving average of % D.  
A 3‑line Stochastics provides an anticipatory signal in % K, a signal in the turnaround of % D at or before a bottom, and a confirmation of the turnaround in % D‑Slow.  
Typical values for N in the Stochastics indicator are 5, 9, or 14 periods.  
Smoothing the Stochastics indicator over 3 periods is standard practice.  
George Lane recommends using the Stochastics indicator together with cycles, Elliott Wave Theory, and Fibonacci retracement for timing.  
In low‑margin calendar futures spreads, traders may use Wilder’s parabolic SAR as a trailing stop after a Stochastics entry.  
Lane’s teaching emphasizes the divergence and convergence of trendlines drawn on Stochastics relative to trendlines drawn on price cycles.  
Stochastics predicts market tops and bottoms.  
The trading signal occurs when a divergence‑convergence pattern appears in an extreme area with a crossover on the right side of a cycle bottom.  
Because plain crossovers occur frequently, traders typically wait for crossovers that coincide with an extreme pullback after a peak or trough in the % D line.  
When price volatility is high, applying an exponential moving average to the % D indicator can smooth rapid price fluctuations.  
Stochastics attempts to predict turning points by comparing a security’s closing price to its recent price range.  
Prices tend to close near the extremes of the recent range just before turning points.  
In an uptrend, prices usually make higher highs and the settlement price tends to be in the upper end of the period’s trading range.  
When momentum slows, settlement prices retreat from the upper range boundaries, causing the Stochastics indicator to turn down.
