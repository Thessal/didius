Low_N is the lowest price over the last N periods.  
High_N is the highest price over the last N periods.  
% D is a 3‑period simple moving average of % K.  
% D‑Slow is a 3‑period simple moving average of % D.  
A 3‑line Stochastics indicator provides an anticipatory signal in % K, a signal in the turnaround of % D at or before a bottom, and a confirmation of the turnaround in % D‑Slow.  
Typical values for N in the Stochastics indicator are 5, 9, or 14 periods.  
Smoothing the Stochastics indicator over 3 periods is standard practice.  
According to George Lane, the Stochastics indicator is used with cycles, Elliott Wave Theory, and Fibonacci retracement for timing.  
In low‑margin calendar futures spreads, Wilders’ parabolic may be used as a trailing stop after a Stochastics entry.  
A central teaching of George Lane is that divergence and convergence of trendlines drawn on Stochastics should be compared to trendlines drawn on price cycles.  
Stochastics predicts market tops and bottoms.  
The signal to act is when there is a divergence‑convergence in an extreme area with a crossover on the right‑hand side of a cycle bottom.  
Because plain crossovers can occur frequently, traders typically wait for crossovers that occur together with an extreme pullback after a peak or trough in the % D line.  
If price volatility is high, an exponential moving average of the % D indicator may be taken to smooth rapid fluctuations.  
Stochastics attempts to predict turning points by comparing the closing price of a security to its price range, with prices tending to close near the extremes of the recent range just before turning points.  
In an uptrend, prices tend to make higher highs and the settlement price usually lies in the upper end of the period’s trading range.  
When momentum slows, settlement prices retreat from the upper boundaries of the range, causing the stochastic indicator to turn down.
