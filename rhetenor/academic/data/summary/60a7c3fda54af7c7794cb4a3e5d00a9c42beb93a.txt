Market predictions lack validity or significance other than random.  
The market has its own law; without it there would be no axis for prices to circulate and price fluctuations would be spontaneous and erratic.  
Careful market research shows that price movements are rhythmic, systematized, adjusted, and harmonious rather than random.  
Wave patterns emerge and become visible to the trained eye when a registration mechanism is available.  
Daily range (price) recording of stock transactions was introduced in 1928.  
Hourly recording of stock transactions was introduced in 1932.  
Observing waves at minor and minute levels, especially in fast markets, requires daily and hourly recording.  
Contrary to Dow Theory, the “Law of Nature” does not require confirmation for two stock indices; each index, group, or stock is interpreted by its own waves.  
The wave principle was published in 1938 as “The Law of Waves”.
