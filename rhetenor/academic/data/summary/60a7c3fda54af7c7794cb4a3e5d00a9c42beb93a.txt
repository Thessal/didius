Market predictions lack validity or significance other than random.  
The market has its own law; without it there would be no axis for price circulation.  
Careful market research shows price movements are rhythmic, systematized, adjusted, and harmonious rather than random.  
The wave law can be discovered when the market is viewed from an appropriate angle and analyzed with the described method.  
Daily range (price) recording of stock transactions was introduced in 1928.  
Hourly recording of stock transactions was introduced in 1932.  
Recording daily and hourly price ranges is necessary to observe waves at minor and minute levels, especially in fast markets.  
Contrary to Dow Theory, the “Law of Nature” does not require confirmation for two stock indices; each index, group, or stock is interpreted by its own waves.  
Charting the extremes (high and low) of the daily range reveals all levels of waves as they form.
