"ADXR rates commodities, currencies, stocks, etc., on a directional movement scale.",21,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"ADXR equals the average of today's ADX and the ADX from 14 days ago.",23,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"ADXR must indicate directional movement while showing minimal fluctuation during direction changes.",27,5,4,4,4,4,5,5
"When plotted, the ADX typically forms a sine‑like curve.",10,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"The curve’s amplitude is measured from the zero line, with peaks and valleys marking direction changes.",18,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"If the trend is down, peaks are low and valleys high; if up, peaks are high and valleys low.",29,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"Higher amplitude signifies stronger directional movement in one direction, indicating a strong trend.",13,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"Larger peak‑valley distances generate stronger trend reactions, potentially profitable in both directions.",19,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"ADXR should reflect good directional movement without excessive fluctuation at equilibrium points.",15,5,4,4,4,4,5,5
"This is achieved by averaging a 14‑day differential of the ADX.",11,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"Good directional movement includes movements that exceed the equilibrium point, not just straight up or down.",18,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"The equilibrium point occurs when +DI14 equals -DI14.",9,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
"Figure 4.11 shows a low ADX value with swings around equilibrium points.",16,4,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Figure 4.12 shows a higher ADX because the distance between equilibrium points is larger.",14,4,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Figure 4.13 shows an even higher ADX as the equilibrium point was reached only once.",18,4,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Figure 4.14 illustrates an extreme where distance between points B and C is zero, making trades break even or cause loss.",39,4,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Some directional movement exists due to distance between points E and F.",12,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"This pattern is typical when ADXR is less than 20.",10,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"When ADXR exceeds 25, equilibrium points become wider.",9,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
"High directional movement relative to a 14‑day period causes equilibrium points to occur immediately after a turn.",32,4,4,4,1,4,5,5
