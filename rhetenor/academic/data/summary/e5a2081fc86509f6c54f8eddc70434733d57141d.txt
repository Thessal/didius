Today's +DM14 equals previous +DM14 minus one fourteenth of previous +DM14 plus today's +DM.  
Today's -DM14 equals previous -DM14 minus one fourteenth of previous -DM14 plus today's -DM.  
If today's directional movement (DM) is negative, its value is added back to the -DM14; if it is positive, its value is added back to the +DM14.  
Today's TR14 equals previous TR14 minus one fourteenth of previous TR14 plus today's true range.  
+DI14 represents the percentage of the total true range over the last 14 days that was upward; -DI14 represents the percentage that was downward, and both values are positive.  
The Directional Movement Index (DX) is the difference between +DI and -DI expressed as a value between 0 and 100.  
After 14 days, the total true range (TR14) calculated by summing each day's true range equals 41.00.  
After 14 days, the total +DM14 calculated by summing the daily +DM values equals 9.50.  
After 14 days, the total -DM14 calculated by summing the daily -DM values equals 14.00.  
For day 15, TR14 is computed as 41.00 minus (41.00/14) plus 5.25, resulting in 43.32.  
For day 15, +DM14 is computed as 9.50 minus (9.50/14) plus 0, resulting in 8.82.  
For day 15, -DM14 is computed as 14.00 minus (14.00/14) plus 2.75, resulting in 15.75.  
In each calculation, the previous total is decreased by one fourteenth and then the applicable daily DM is added back.  
The true range column always has a value to add back each day, whereas on day 15 the +DM was zero, so nothing was added back to +DM14.  
On day 15, the -DM value of 2.75 was added back to -DM14.
