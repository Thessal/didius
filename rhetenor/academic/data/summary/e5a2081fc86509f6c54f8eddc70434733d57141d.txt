Today's +DM14 equals the previous +DM14 minus one‑fourteenth of the previous +DM14 plus today’s +DM.  
Today's -DM14 equals the previous -DM14 minus one‑fourteenth of the previous -DM14 plus today’s -DM.  
Each day one‑fourteenth of the +DM and one‑fourteenth of the -DM are removed from their respective 14‑day totals.  
If today’s DM is negative, its value is added back to the -DM14; if today’s DM is positive, its value is added back to the +DM14.  
The same procedure is used for the True Range: Today's TR14 equals the previous TR14 minus one‑fourteenth of the previous TR14 plus today’s True Range.  
The +DI14 indicates the percentage of the total true range of the last 14 days that was up; the -DI14 indicates the percentage that was down, and both values are positive.  
The Directional Movement Index (DX) is the difference between +DI and -DI expressed as a value between 0 and 100.  
After the first 14 days, the total True Range (TR14) is 41.00.  
After the first 14 days, the total +DM14 is 9.50.  
After the first 14 days, the total -DM14 is 14.00.  
On day 15, TR14 is calculated as 41.00 minus (41.00 / 14) plus 5.25, resulting in 43.32.  
On day 15, +DM14 is calculated as 9.50 minus (9.50 / 14) plus 0, resulting in 8.82.  
On day 15, -DM14 is calculated as 14.00 minus (14.00 / 14) plus 2.75, resulting in 15.75.  
In each case the previous total is decreased by one‑fourteenth and then the applicable DM for the day is added back.
