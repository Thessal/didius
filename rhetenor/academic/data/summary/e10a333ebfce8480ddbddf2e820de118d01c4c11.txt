In finance, a trend line is a bounding line for the price movement of a security.  
A trend line is formed when a diagonal line can be drawn between at least three price pivot points.  
A line drawn between only two points does not qualify as a trend line until it is tested with a third point.  
Trend lines are commonly used to decide entry and exit timing when trading securities.  
Trend lines are also called Dutch lines because the concept originated in Holland.  
A support trend line forms when a security’s price decreases and then rebounds at a pivot point that aligns with at least two previous support pivot points.  
A resistance trend line forms when a security’s price increases and then rebounds at a pivot point that aligns with at least two previous resistance pivot points.  
Stocks often begin or end trending because of catalysts such as product launches or changes in management.  
Trend lines are a simple and widely used technical analysis tool for judging entry and exit timing in investments.  
Establishing a trend line requires historical price data typically presented in chart form.  
Historically, trend lines were drawn by hand on paper charts, but today they are usually drawn with charting software on computer-based charts.  
Some charting software can automatically generate trend lines, though most traders prefer to draw their own.  
When establishing trend lines, it is important to choose a chart interval that aligns with the trader’s strategy.  
Short‑term traders typically use charts with intervals such as 1 minute, while longer‑term traders use hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly intervals.  
Long‑term price data are often displayed on a logarithmic scale to approximate percentage changes rather than absolute price changes.  
Trend lines are typically used with price charts but can also be applied to other technical analysis charts such as MACD and RSI.  
Trend lines can identify positive or negative trends: an upsloping line indicates a positive trend when support and resistance pivot points align, and a downsloping line indicates a negative trend when they align.  
If a stock price moves between support and resistance trend lines, a common strategy is to buy at support, sell at resistance, and then short at resistance.
