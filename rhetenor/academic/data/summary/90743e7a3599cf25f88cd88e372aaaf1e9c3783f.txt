Wave 5 breaks the parallel line on the Dow Index chart when plotted on an arithmetic scale.  
Converting the Dow Index chart from 1921 to a logarithmic scale shows that wave 5 touches but does not break the parallel line.  
There are three methods to predict where a breakout will end: using a logarithmic scale, the wave ratio, and the time factor.  
When the gold price chart from 1250 to 1939 is drawn on an arithmetic scale, the price movement is above the parallel line, requiring a semi‑logarithmic scale for proper representation.
