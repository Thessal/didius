The mass index is an indicator developed by Donald Dorsey that is used in technical analysis to predict trend reversals.  
The mass index is based on the notion that price range widening creates a tendency for reversal, so it compares previous trading ranges (highs minus lows).  
The mass index for a commodity is calculated by taking the exponential moving average (EMA) of the high‑low range over a 9‑day period, then taking the EMA of that EMA, and summing the ratio of these two values over a given number of days, usually 25.  
Generally the EMA and the re‑smoothed EMA are fairly close, making their ratio roughly 1 and the sum around 25.  
According to Dorsey, a “reversal bulge” in the mass index is a probable signal of a trend reversal regardless of the trend’s direction.  
A reversal bulge occurs when a 25‑day mass index reaches 27.0 and then falls below 26 (or 26.5).  
A 9‑day prime moving average is usually used to determine whether the bulge signals a buy or a sell.  
The mass index formula uses intraday range values, not the “true range,” which adjusts for full and partial gaps.  
The bulge indicated by the mass index does not specify the direction of the subsequent price move.
