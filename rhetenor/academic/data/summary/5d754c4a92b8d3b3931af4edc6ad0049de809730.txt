The mass index is an indicator developed by Donald Dorsey used in technical analysis to predict trend reversals.  
The mass index is based on the notion that there is a tendency for reversal when the price range widens, and therefore compares previous trading ranges (highs minus lows).  
The mass index for a commodity is obtained by calculating its exponential moving average over a 9‑day period and the exponential moving average of this average (a double average), and summing the ratio of these two over a given number of days (usually 25).  
Generally the EMA and the re‑smoothed EMA of EMA are fairly close, making their ratio roughly 1 and the sum around 25.  
According to Dorsey, a “reversal bulge” is a probable signal of trend reversal regardless of the trend’s direction.  
A reversal bulge takes place when a 25‑day mass index reaches 27.0 and then falls to below 26 (or 26.5).  
A 9‑day prime moving average is usually used to determine whether the bulge is a buy or sell signal.  
The formula uses intraday range values, not the true range which adjusts for full and partial gaps.  
The bulge does not indicate direction.
