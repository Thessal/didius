ATR_t = (ATR_{t-1} × (n − 1) + TR_t) / n.  
The first ATR value is calculated as the arithmetic mean: ATR = (1/n) × ∑_{i=1}^{n} TR_i.  
The first ATR value is the first point in the time series (not the most recent) and occurs n periods from the beginning of the chart.  
Large or increasing price ranges suggest traders are prepared to continue bidding up or selling down a stock during the day, while decreasing ranges suggest waning interest.  
Because true range and ATR are based on price differences, their volatility measure is unchanged when historical prices are back‑adjusted by adding or subtracting a constant.  
Standard deviation of logarithmic price ratios, a common stock volatility measure, is not invariant to addition of a constant.  
Futures traders and analysts typically use ATR to calculate volatility, whereas stock traders and analysts typically use the standard deviation of log price ratios.  
ATR is used as an element of position sizing in financial trading.  
Current ATR value (or a multiple of it) can be used as the size of the potential adverse movement (stop‑loss distance) when calculating trade volume based on a trader’s risk tolerance.  
ATR provides a self‑adjusting risk limit dependent on market volatility for strategies without a fixed stop‑loss placement.
