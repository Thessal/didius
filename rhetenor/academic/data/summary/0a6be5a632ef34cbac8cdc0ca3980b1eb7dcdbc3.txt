ATR_t = (ATR_{t-1} × (n − 1) + TR_t) / n.  
The first ATR value is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the first n true range values: ATR = (1/n) ∑_{i=1}^{n} TR_i.  
The first ATR value is the first in the time series and occurs n periods from the beginning of the chart.  
Large or increasing ranges suggest traders are prepared to continue to bid up or sell down a stock during the day, while decreasing ranges suggest waning interest.  
Since true range and ATR are calculated by subtracting prices, their volatility measure does not change when historical prices are back‑adjusted by adding or subtracting a constant.  
The standard deviation of logarithmic price ratios is not invariant to addition of a constant, unlike ATR.  
Futures traders and analysts typically use ATR to calculate volatility, whereas stock traders and analysts typically use the standard deviation of log price ratios.  
ATR can be used as an element of position sizing in financial trading.  
The current ATR value (or a multiple of it) can be used as the size of the potential adverse movement (stop‑loss distance) when calculating trade volume based on a trader’s risk tolerance.  
ATR provides a self‑adjusting risk limit dependent on market volatility for strategies without a fixed stop‑loss placement.
