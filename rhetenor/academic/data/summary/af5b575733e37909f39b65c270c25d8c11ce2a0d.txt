The Directional Movement Index (DX) is calculated as the DI difference divided by the sum of DI values, expressed as a percentage.  
The Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) after 14 days is the average of the 14 DX values.  
Subsequent ADX values are calculated using the moving‑average formula: (previous ADX × 13 + today’s DX) / 14.  
The ADX rating (ADXR) is the average of the current ADX and the ADX from 14 days ago.  
The Average True Range over 14 days (ATR14) is the average of the 14‑day True Range values.  
The Commodity Selection Index (CSI) incorporates ADXR, ATR14, and other metrics to rate commodities, currencies, and stocks.  
The ADXR is used as a rating of directional movement for stocks.  
On day 28, the ADX calculated from the first 14 DX values equals 1.86.  
On day 29, the ADX calculated using (previous ADX × 13 + DX today) / 14 equals approximately 17 (rounded).
