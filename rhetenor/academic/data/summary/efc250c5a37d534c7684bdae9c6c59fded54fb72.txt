The accumulation/distribution line or index is a technical analysis indicator intended to relate price and volume, acting as a leading indicator of price movements.  
It provides a measure of the commitment of bulls and bears to the market and is used to detect divergences between volume and price action, which are signs that a trend is weakening.  
The CLV (close‑low minus high‑close divided by high‑low) ranges from –1 when the close is the low of the day to +1 when it is the high.  
The accumulation/distribution index adds up volume multiplied by the CLV factor: accdist = accdist_prev + volume × CLV.  
The starting point for the accumulation/distribution total is arbitrary; only the shape of the resulting indicator is used, not the actual level of the total.  
The name accumulation/distribution comes from the idea that during accumulation buyers are in control and the price will be bid up through the day or recover if sold down, more often finishing near the day’s high than the low.  
The opposite applies during distribution.  
The accumulation/distribution index is similar to on‑balance volume, but is based on the close within the day’s range instead of close‑to‑close changes.  
A Chaikin oscillator is formed by subtracting a 10‑day exponential moving average from a 3‑day exponential moving average of the accumulation/distribution index.  
The Chaikin oscillator can give various sell or buy signals depending on the context and other indicators.
