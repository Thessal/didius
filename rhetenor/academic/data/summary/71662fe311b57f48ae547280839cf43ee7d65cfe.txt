RSI is calculated as 100 × (1 − SMMA(D,n) / (SMMA(U,n)+SMMA(D,n))) = 100 − 100 / (1+RS).  
If the average of U values is zero, both RS and RSI are zero.  
If the average of U values equals the average of D values, RS equals 1 and RSI equals 50.  
If the average of U values is maximal and the average of D values is zero, RS diverges to infinity and RSI equals 100.  
Wilder recommended a smoothing period of 14 for the RSI (α = 1/14 or N = 14).  
The RSI is typically displayed with upper and lower lines at 70 and 30 and a mid‑line at 50.  
Wilder posited that rapid price increases create overbought conditions and rapid price decreases create oversold conditions, implying an imminent reversal.  
The level of the RSI measures a stock’s recent trading strength.  
The slope of the RSI is directly proportional to the velocity of a change in the trend.  
The distance traveled by the RSI is proportional to the magnitude of the move.  
Wilder believed that RSI readings above 70 indicate overbought territory and readings below 30 indicate oversold territory.  
RSI readings between 30 and 70 are considered neutral, with 50 indicating no trend.  
Divergence between RSI and price action is a strong indication that a market turning point is imminent.  
Bearish divergence occurs when price makes a new high but the RSI makes a lower high.  
Bullish divergence occurs when price makes a new low but the RSI makes a higher low.  
Wilder thought that “failure swings” above 50 and below 50 on the RSI are strong indications of market reversals.  
Chart formations and areas of support and resistance can sometimes be more easily seen on the RSI chart than on the price chart.  
The center line for the RSI is 50.
