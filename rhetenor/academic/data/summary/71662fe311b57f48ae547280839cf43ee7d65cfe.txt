RSI is calculated as 100 × (1 − SMMA(D,n) / (SMMA(U,n)+SMMA(D,n))) = 100 − 100 / (1+RS).  
If the average of U values is zero, both RS and RSI are zero.  
If the average of U values equals the average of D values, RS equals 1 and RSI equals 50.  
If the average of U values is maximal (average of D values is zero), RS diverges to infinity and RSI equals 100.  
Wilder recommended a smoothing period of 14 for RSI (α = 1/14 or N = 14).  
The RSI is displayed on a chart above or below the price chart with typical upper and lower lines at 70 and 30 and a mid‑line at 50.  
Wilder posited that rapid price moves create overbought (high RSI) or oversold (low RSI) conditions, indicating an imminent reversal.  
The level of the RSI measures a stock’s recent trading strength.  
The slope of the RSI is directly proportional to the velocity of a change in the trend.  
The distance traveled by the RSI is proportional to the magnitude of the price move.  
Wilder believed that tops and bottoms are indicated when RSI goes above 70 or drops below 30.  
RSI readings greater than 70 are considered overbought; readings lower than 30 are considered oversold; readings between 30 and 70 are neutral; a reading of 50 indicates no trend.  
Divergence between RSI and price action is a strong indication that a market turning point is imminent.  
Bearish divergence occurs when price makes a new high but RSI makes a lower high.  
Bullish divergence occurs when price makes a new low but RSI makes a higher low.  
Wilder thought that “failure swings” above 50 and below 50 on the RSI are strong indications of market reversals.  
Chart formations and support/resistance areas can sometimes be more easily seen on the RSI chart than on the price chart.  
The center line for the RSI is 50.
