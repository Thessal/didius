Fibonacci retracement is a popular tool that technical traders use to help identify strategic places for transactions, stop losses or target prices to help traders get in at a good price.  
The main idea behind the tool is the support and resistance values for a trend at which the most important breaks or bounces can appear.  
The retracement concept is used in many indicators such as Tirone levels, Gartley patterns, Elliott wave principle, and more.  
Unlike moving averages, Fibonacci retracement levels are static prices, allowing quick and simple identification and allowing traders and investors to react when price levels are tested.  
Because these levels are inflection points, traders expect some type of price action, either a break or a rejection.  
The 61.8% (0.618) Fibonacci retracement corresponds to the golden ratio.  
Arthur Merrill in Filtered Waves determined there is no reliably standard retracement.  
The significance of such levels could not be confirmed by examining the data.  
The appearance of retracement can be ascribed to price volatility as described by Burton Malkiel.  
Extensive backtests of Fibonacci retracement over thousands of stocks have shown that the retracement values of 38%, 50%, and 62% were no likelier to appear than any other possible retracement values.
