Fibonacci retracement is a popular tool that technical traders use to help identify strategic places for transactions, stop losses or target prices to help traders get in at a good price.  
Unlike moving averages, Fibonacci retracement levels are static prices, allowing quick and simple identification and enabling traders and investors to react when price levels are tested.  
The 61.8% (0.618) Fibonacci retracement commonly used by financial analysts corresponds to the golden ratio.  
Extensive backtests of Fibonacci retracement over thousands of stocks have shown that the retracement values of 38%, 50%, and 62% were no more likely to appear than any other possible retracement values.  
A Fibonacci retracement forecast is created by taking two extreme points on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by Fibonacci ratios.  
Common Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%.  
In Fibonacci retracement, 0% represents the start of the retracement and 100% represents a complete reversal to the original price before the move.
