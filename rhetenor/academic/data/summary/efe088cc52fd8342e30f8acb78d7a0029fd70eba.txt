MACD, short for moving average convergence/divergence, is a trading indicator used in technical analysis of securities prices, created by Gerald Appel in the late 1970s.  
It is designed to reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock's price.  
The MACD indicator (or “oscillator”) is a collection of three time series calculated from historical price data, most often the closing price.  
The three series are the MACD series proper, the signal (average) series, and the divergence series, which is the difference between the MACD and signal lines.  
The MACD series is the difference between a fast (short‑period) exponential moving average (EMA) and a slow (longer‑period) EMA of the price series.  
The signal series is an EMA of the MACD series itself.  
The MACD indicator depends on three time parameters: the time constants of the fast EMA, the slow EMA, and the EMA applied to the MACD series.  
The notation “MACD(a,b,c)” denotes an indicator where the MACD series is the difference of EMAs with periods a and b, and the signal series is an EMA of the MACD series with period c.  
These parameters are usually measured in days.  
The most commonly used values are 12, 26, and 9 days, i.e., MACD(12,26,9).  
Historically, MACD period settings were based on daily charts because early technical analysis relied on daily data and lacked modern platforms that display continuous price changes.  
When trading weeks were six days, the (12,26,9) settings corresponded to roughly two weeks, one month, and one and a half weeks.  
With modern five‑day trading weeks, traders may adjust the period settings, but it is generally advisable to use the settings most commonly employed by the majority of traders.
