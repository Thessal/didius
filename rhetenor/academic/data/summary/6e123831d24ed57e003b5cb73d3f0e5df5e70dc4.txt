The Smart Money Index (SMI) and the Smart Money Flow Index (SMFI) are technical analysis indicators demonstrating investors' sentiment.  
The SMI was invented and popularized by money manager Don Hays.  
The SMFI is based on Hays' SMI but uses a slightly different proprietary formula to measure the investment behavior of institutional investors.  
The two indicators can produce different signals despite appearing similar.  
The SMFI is called the Smart Money Flow Index and is featured on Bloomberg Professional.  
Both indicators are based on intra-day price patterns.  
The Smart Money Index (SMI) is a composite sentiment indicator that is based upon intra-day price patterns in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  
The SMI was described nearly twenty years ago by Lynn Elgert in the February 22, 1988 issue of Barron’s.  
The basic formula for SMI is: Today's SMI reading = yesterday's SMI – opening gain or loss + last hour change.  
If yesterday's SMI closed at 10,000, the Dow Jones gained 100 points in the first 30 minutes and lost 80 points in the final hour, then today's SMI is 9,820.
