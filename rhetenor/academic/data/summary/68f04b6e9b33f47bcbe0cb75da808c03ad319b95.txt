TRIX is a technical analysis oscillator developed in the 1980s by Jack Hutson, editor of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine.  
TRIX shows the slope (derivative) of a triple‑smoothed exponential moving average.  
The name TRIX comes from “triple exponential.”  
TRIX is a triple‑smoothed exponential moving average used in technical analysis to follow trends.  
Positive TRIX values indicate bullish price trends, while negative TRIX values indicate bearish price trends.  
TRIX crossing zero indicates a trend change.  
A TRIX signal line, a moving average with a smaller period, is used to anticipate where the TRIX line is headed.  
TRIX crossing above its signal line implies that the price will likely move higher.  
TRIX crossing below its signal line implies that the price will likely move lower.  
TRIX is calculated by smoothing prices with an N‑day EMA, smoothing the result with another N‑day EMA, smoothing a third time with a further N‑day EMA, and then calculating the percentage difference between today’s and yesterday’s value in the final smoothed series.  
The triple EMA is a smoothing of price data and therefore is trend‑following.  
A rising or falling triple‑EMA line represents an uptrend or downtrend, and TRIX shows the slope of that line, being positive for a steady uptrend, negative for a downtrend, and crossing zero at a trend change.  
The triple‑smoothed EMA differs from a plain EMA; applying the EMA three times spreads weightings more broadly, making the weights for the most recent days smaller than those for days further in the past.  
For an N‑day triple EMA, the distribution’s mode lies at p_{N‑2}; for example, with N=10, p8 carries the highest weighting.  
An N of 1 is invalid for calculating TRIX.  
The easiest way to calculate the triple EMA is to apply the EMA three successive times, creating single‑, double‑, then triple‑smoothed series.  
The triple EMA can be expressed directly in terms of prices as a function of today’s close p₀, yesterday’s close p₁, etc., with smoothing factor f = 1 − 2/(N+1) = (N‑1)/(N+1).
