The 1932‑1937 rise and the 1937‑1938 fall are both five‑wave movements, which prevents them from being sub‑waves of a triangle because triangle sub‑waves must be three‑wave structures.  
The concept of a thirteen‑year triangle in the 1928‑1942 period is invalid.  
The most compelling evidence for a triangle formation was a series of 0.618 retracements within perfectly converging lines.  
Elliott describes the first three waves together as a wave flat because the third wave of the triangle is a five‑wave structure.  
If the 1937‑1938 move is the C wave of a wave plane, it must be a five; if it is a triangle wave, it must be a three.  
Elliott’s labeling in figures 72 and 74 does not fit his suggested triangle but matches the correct interpretation of the wave pattern.  
It is possible to count a certain five‑wave movement as a three‑wave structure only to preserve the Wave Principle’s “correct appearance.”  
Wave planes are called “flat” because they do not contain overlapping waves.  
Wave B flat always extends deep into wave A territory.  
In a five‑wave movement there is no wave overlap by definition; therefore the 1932‑1937 rise should be classified as a five‑wave.  
Wave planes are flat and should not “fall.”  
The 1937‑1938 decline is a five‑wave drop without any overlap, completing the zigzag that began in 1937.  
A slightly better layout includes a horizontal triangle as the B wave.  
This is the most dramatic bull market in US history in terms of percentage growth.
