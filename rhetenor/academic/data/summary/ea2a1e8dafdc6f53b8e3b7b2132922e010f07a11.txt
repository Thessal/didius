The 1932‑1937 rise and the 1937‑1938 fall are both five‑wave movements, which conflicts with the requirement that sub‑waves of a triangle be three‑wave movements.  
The concept of a thirteen‑year triangle for the 1928‑1942 period is invalid.  
The most compelling argument for the formation of the triangle was the sequence of 0.618 retracements within perfect converging lines.  
Elliott breaks his own rule because the 1937‑1938 move cannot be both a “C” wave (a five) and a triangle wave (a three) simultaneously.  
Elliott’s labeling in figures 72 and 74 does not fit his suggested triangle but matches the correct interpretation of the wave pattern.  
It is possible to count a certain five‑wave movement as a three‑wave movement only to conform to the Wave Principle’s notion of “correct appearance.”  
Wave planes are flat and should not fall; the 1937‑1938 movement is a five‑wave drop without overlap, completing the zigzag that began in 1937.  
The 1939‑April 1942 wave is a wave flat.  
This is the most dramatic bull market in US history in terms of percentage growth.
