The shift to decimal pricing began in 1997 with 1/16-point increments and was fully implemented by the NYSE on January 29, 2001 and by Nasdaq on April 9, 2001.  
Previously a stock needed a price change of at least 1/8 of a point to be counted as advancing or declining; after decimalization a single penny change suffices.  
Critics argue that the increased number of votes from small-price-change stocks biases the advance‑decline line upward.  
A study of NYSE closing data from November 1, 2001 to March 5, 2004 found that the sub‑tick group (price changes ≤ 1/16 point) has a weaker bias than the market overall and actually holds back the composite cumulative advance‑decline ratio.  
In 1872 the NYSE implemented a continuous trading system that replaced scheduled stock calls and gave rise to the specialist system.  
Under the specialist system a single independent trader or company manages the auction market for specific securities from a designated post on the trading floor.  
Specialists are tasked with making a market in their assigned issues and use their own capital to bridge temporary supply‑demand gaps, reducing price volatility.  
Because specialists have large influence over a stock’s price and may hold positions in the same issue, many market participants are concerned that specialists could rig the market for their own benefit.  
Data indicate that sub‑tick price changes have restrained the composite cumulative advance‑decline ratio, refuting the notion that decimalization made the advance‑decline line artificially bullish.  
The advance‑decline line remains a useful indicator, provided analysts interpret its signals rather than dismiss it for not matching expectations.  
Very strong advance‑decline statistics observed in 2003‑2004 suggest that substantial upside for stock prices is likely.  
Although ordinary declines may occur, the strong market breadth implies that a more meaningful decline is unlikely for many months.
