Decimal pricing shifted to begin in 1997 with 1/16-point increments and was fully implemented by the NYSE on Jan 29 2001 and Nasdaq on Apr 9 2001.  
Previously a stock needed a price change of at least 1/8 of a point to be counted as advancing or declining; after decimalization a single penny change suffices.  
Critics argue that the increased number of votes from small-price-change stocks biases the A‑D line upward.  
A study of NYSE closing data from Nov 1 2001 to Mar 5 2004 examined three issue categories: all stocks, > 1/16‑point price changes, and ≤ 1/16‑point price changes.  
The 1/16‑point (6.25 cents) threshold assumes that a 7‑cent move should be rounded up to the old 1/8‑point increment (12.5 cents) and counted, while moves of 6 cents or less are treated as unchanged.  
Cumulative A‑D ratios show that the sub‑tick group (≤ 1/16‑point changes) has a weaker bias than the market overall and actually holds back the composite cumulative A‑D ratio.  
Consequently decimalization has not artificially created a more bullish A‑D line.  
In 1872 the NYSE implemented a continuous trading system that replaced scheduled stock calls.  
The continuous trading system gave rise to the specialist system, where a single independent trader or company manages the auction market for specific securities.  
Specialists are tasked with making a market in their issues and use their own capital to bridge temporary supply‑demand gaps, reducing price volatility.  
Because specialists have large influence over a stock’s price and hold vested interests, many market participants worry that specialists may have too much power to rig the market for their issues.  
Although ratio‑adjusted A‑D statistics have been criticized for decimalization effects, data indicate that sub‑tick price changes have restrained the composite cumulative A‑D ratio, refuting the notion that decimalization made the A‑D line artificially bullish.  
The A‑D line remains a useful indicator, but analysts should interpret its signals rather than dismiss it for not matching expectations.  
Very strong A‑D statistics in 2003‑2004 suggest that much more upside is likely for stock prices.  
While ordinary declines may occur, the strong breadth implies that a meaningful market decline will likely not appear for many months.
