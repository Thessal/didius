Keltner channel is a technical analysis indicator that consists of a central moving average line with channel lines drawn above and below it.  
The indicator is named after Chester W. Keltner, who described it in his 1960 book *How To Make Money in Commodities*.  
Keltner referred to the method as the ten‑day moving average trading rule and did not claim originality for the idea.  
In Keltner’s description, the center line is a 10‑day simple moving average of the typical price, where typical price is the average of the high, low, and close for each day.  
The upper and lower lines are placed at a distance equal to the simple moving average of the past 10 days’ trading ranges (high minus low).  
The trading strategy treats a close above the upper line as a strong bullish signal and a close below the lower line as a strong bearish signal, prompting buying or selling with the trend, possibly confirmed by other indicators.  
Keltner was a Chicago grain trader, and the concept may have been common knowledge among traders of his era.  
Concepts of channels with fixed widths date back to the earliest days of charting.  
Later authors such as Linda Bradford Raschke have published modifications to the Keltner channel, including different averaging periods, the use of an exponential moving average, and using a multiple of Wilder’s average true range for the bands.
