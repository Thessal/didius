Keltner channel is a technical analysis indicator showing a central moving average line plus channel lines at a distance above and below.  
The indicator is named after Chester W. Keltner (1909–1998) who described it in his 1960 book *How To Make Money in Commodities*.  
Keltner called it the ten‑day moving average trading rule and made no claim to any originality for the idea.  
In Keltner's description the center line is a 10‑day simple moving average of typical price, where typical price each day is the average of high, low and close.  
The lines above and below are drawn a distance from that center line equal to the simple moving average of the past 10 days' trading ranges (high‑to‑low on each day).  
The trading strategy is to regard a close above the upper line as a strong bullish signal, or a close below the lower line as a strong bearish signal, and to buy or sell with the trend accordingly, possibly using other indicators for confirmation.  
Ideas of channels with fixed widths go back to the earliest days of charting.  
Later authors such as Linda Bradford Raschke have published modifications for the Keltner channel, including different averaging periods, an exponential moving average, or using a multiple of Wilder's average true range (ATR) for the bands.
