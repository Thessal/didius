The 14‑day average up close is calculated by summing the up‑close values and dividing by 14.  
The 14‑day average down close is calculated by summing the down‑close values and dividing by 14.  
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is derived by first dividing the average up close by the average down close, adding 1, dividing 100 by that sum, and then subtracting the result from 100.  
After the initial 14‑day period, RSI is updated using only the previous day's average up close and average down close.  
The average up close for a new day is computed by multiplying the prior average up close by 13, adding the current day's up close, and dividing the total by 14.  
The average down close for a new day is computed by multiplying the prior average down close by 13, adding the current day's down close (if any), and dividing the total by 14.  
The averaging technique used in RSI eliminates erroneous erratic movement while keeping the indicator responsive to price changes.  
RSI values always range between 0 and 100, providing a common scale for measuring daily momentum across different commodities or stocks.  
The most active commodities or stocks are identified by the greatest vertical movement in their RSI values.  
Once the initial RSI is calculated, only the previous day's data is needed for subsequent RSI calculations.
