A move that exceeds the top of the fifth wave (orthodox top) is the top of the extended wave flat.  
The top of the fifth wave can be an orthodox top.  
The first down‑move from the top of wave 5 is likely three waves long and is labeled wave A.  
The next up‑move may exceed the top of wave 5 and is labeled wave B.  
The subsequent down‑move is likely a five‑wave move and is labeled wave C.  
Waves A, B and C together constitute a single correction, even though the end of wave B may be higher than wave 5.  
If wave A is a simple zigzag, then wave B can be an inverted flat.  
Bull and bear markets alternate.  
A bull market has five waves, while a bear market has three.  
A bullish move consists of five waves.  
Waves 1, 3 and 5 are ascending.  
Waves 2 and 4 are descending or sideways.  
Odd‑numbered waves alternate with even‑numbered waves.  
Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves.  
If wave 2 is simple, then wave 4 can be complex, and vice versa.  
A simple correction at lower wave levels consists of a single downward wave.  
A complex correction consists of three downward or sideways waves.  
At higher wave levels, corrective waves are correspondingly larger in long bull and bear markets.  
The corrective pattern consists of a downward movement labeled A, followed by an upward wave B, and a final downward movement C.  
Wave A can be a zigzag.  
If wave A is a zigzag, wave B can be an inverted wave plane.  
If wave A is a wave flat, wave B can be an inverted zigzag.  
Wave C consists of five downward waves and may reach the starting point of the previous bull market.
