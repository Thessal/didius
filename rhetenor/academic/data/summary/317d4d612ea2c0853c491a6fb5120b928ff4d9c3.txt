A move that exceeds the top of the fifth wave (orthodox top) is the top of the extended wave flat.  
The top of the fifth wave can be an orthodox top.  
The first down‑move from the top of wave 5 is likely three waves long and is labeled wave A.  
The next up‑move may exceed the top of wave 5 and is labeled wave B, which can consist of three waves.  
The following down‑move is likely a five‑wave move and is labeled wave C.  
Waves A, B, and C together make up a single correction, even though the end of wave B may be higher than wave 5.  
A similar pattern occurred between November 1928 and July 1932.  
If wave A is a simple zigzag, then wave B can be an inverted flat.  
Bull and bear markets alternate.  
A bull market has five waves, while a bear market has three.  
The alternation rule (five‑wave versus three‑wave structure) applies to all wave levels.  
A bullish move consists of five waves: waves 1, 3, 5 ascend and waves 2, 4 descend or move sideways.  
Odd‑numbered waves alternate with even‑numbered waves.  
Waves 2 and 4 are corrective, and the pattern of correction alternates between them.  
If wave 2 is simple, then wave 4 can be complex, and vice versa.  
A simple correction at lower wave levels consists of a single downward wave; a complex correction consists of three downward or sideways waves.  
At higher wave levels, corrective waves are correspondingly larger.  
In a correction, the first downward movement is labeled capital A, followed by an upward wave B, then a final downward wave C.  
Wave A can be a zigzag; in that case wave B can be an inverted wave plane.  
If wave A is a wave flat, then wave B can be an inverted zigzag.  
Wave C will consist of five downward waves and can be powerful enough to reach the starting point of the previous bull market.  
Thus, waves A and B alternate.
