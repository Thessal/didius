In the juvenile or inexperienced stage, stocks should be avoided because they have not been sufficiently tested by the market.  
In the creative stage, stocks that have flourished significantly are an excellent medium to trade, assuming they have been thoroughly tested by the market.  
In the adult stage, dividends can be consistently reliable and price fluctuations minimal.  
When a credible index wave pattern favors a move, choose a group of stocks that move in unison with the index.  
Within that group, select the stocks that mostly follow the movements of the group.  
Always choose stocks that consistently trade well, have an average price, and are proven leaders.  
Diversify funds by investing approximately the same amount in five to ten stocks, but no more than one of the group.  
A bull market is any rise in prices that consists of the required five waves.  
Defining a bull market or bear market in terms of duration or percentage change in prices is arbitrary.  
Bear markets are almost always shorter than bull markets and tend to 61.8% if they last a long duration of the bull market.  
Most now expect an immediate repeat crash at the low end of another four‑year cycle.
