The juvenile or inexperienced stage of a stock is a period during which the stock should be avoided because it has not been sufficiently tested by the market.  
The creative stage of a stock is a period in which the stock has flourished significantly and is an excellent medium to trade, assuming it has been thoroughly tested by the market.  
The adult stage of a stock is a period of full bloom in which dividends can be consistently reliable and price fluctuations are minimal.  
When a credible index wave pattern favors a move, one should choose a group of stocks that move in unison with the index.  
Within that group, one should choose the stocks that most closely follow the movements of the group.  
One should always choose stocks that consistently trade well, have an average price, and are proven leaders.  
Funds should be diversified by investing approximately the same amount in five to ten stocks, but no more than one stock from any single group.  
A bull market is defined as any rise in prices that consists of the required five waves.  
Defining a “bull market” or “bear market” in terms of duration or percentage change in prices is arbitrary.  
Bear markets are almost always shorter than bull markets and tend to retrace to about 61.8 % of the preceding bull market if they last a long duration of the bull market.  
Following the financial crashes of 1969‑1970 and 1973‑1974, many expect an immediate repeat crash at the low end of another four‑year cycle.  
Some analysts argue that a less “oversold” bottom is possible, and that many years may pass before a deep drop can be expected according to wave pattern analysis.
