When a five-wave rally completes within a channel on a linear scale, there is no breakout.  
The break of the upper parallel line immediately implies the continuation of the development of an extended third wave.  
The Dow Index (DJIA) has followed the same five-wave pattern as patent filings for almost the same period of time.  
Stocks followed the same pattern during the same period, except that from 1928 to 1942 the correction was a triangle instead of waves A, B and C.
