Figure 98 shows a market chart covering the period from 1800 to December 1945.  
Wave 1 from 1800 to 1857 is based on commercial activity because stock market data were unavailable until 1857.  
November 1928 is the top of wave 3, which began the triangle (wave 4).  
After the triangle ended in April 1942, wave 5 (“the throw”) began.  
The throw always exceeds the top of wave 3; in this case wave 3 peaked in November 1928.  
The move from 1921 to November 1928 consisted of three bull markets and two unusually shallow bear markets.  
By December 1945 only one bull market had occurred since 1921.  
It is logical to expect the wave pattern after 1942 to resemble the 1921‑1928 pattern of three bull markets and two shallow bear markets.  
The DJIA segment began in 1921 at 64 and ended in November 1928 at 299, a 235‑point advance.  
The subsequent roll began in April 1942 at 93.  
Adding the 235‑point advance to the 93‑point level gives 328, which is 29 points above the November 1928 high.  
This roll may last eight years, ending around 1950, similar to the 1921‑1929 period.  
During 1921‑1928 the first wave was a normal bull market with no breakout signs.  
The fifth wave ending in November 1928 was a clear breakthrough.  
The first wave from 1942 to 1945 shows signs of a breakthrough.  
The patent application schedule coincides with stock market waves in both time and form, reflecting business activity and mass psychology.
