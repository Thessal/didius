The DJIA formed a thirteen-year triangle from 1928 to April 1942.  
The triangle was followed by a price roll.  
Figure 97 shows the DJIA index with each vertical bar representing one month’s price range.  
Wave 1 of the Primary level is short.  
Wave 3 of the Primary level is longer and its Intermediate waves are labeled a, b, c, d, and e.  
Wave 4 of the Primary level consists of three Intermediate waves labeled a, b, and c from July to November 1943.  
Wave 5 of the Primary level formed from November 1943 to December 10, 1945.  
Waves A and B each lasted five months.  
On daily and weekly timeframes during this period, all waves consist of three sub-waves each.  
Wave 1 of the Intermediate level consists of five daily sub-waves.  
Wave 3 of the Intermediate level consists of five sub-waves labeled a, b, c, d, and e (extended).  
Extensions never appear in more than one sub-wave of impulses 1, 3, and 5.  
Wave 4 of the Intermediate level is the same as wave 2.  
Wave 5 of the Intermediate level consists of five weekly sub-waves and reached 196.59 on December 10, 1945.  
After December 10, 1945, the top of the extended wave flat reached 207.49 on February 4, 1946.  
Wave 5 of the Primary level was unusual because it formed close to the baseline from November 1943 to August 1945 instead of heading straight for the parallel line.  
The anomaly was caused by reckless speculators with more money than experience who preferred cheap stocks over proven securities.  
A Special Index was created that behaved as usual.  
Wave 5 of the Primary level does not cling to the baseline but forms a straight line from beginning to end.  
The DJIA formed its orthodox top at 196.59 on December 10, 1945.  
Wave B, the top of an extended wave plane, is currently being formed.  
Wave C is expected to follow.  
An unusually weak bear market is expected.  
Triangles always form as wave 4, and wave 5 exceeds the top of wave 3.
