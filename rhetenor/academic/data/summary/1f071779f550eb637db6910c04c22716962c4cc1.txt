"Standard deviation σ is estimated from a random sample by computing a statistic used as an estimate of the population standard deviation.",40,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"Such a statistic is called an estimator, and the estimator value is termed a sample standard deviation denoted by s.",33,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"There is no single estimator for standard deviation with all desirable properties, unlike the sample mean, making unbiased estimation technically complex.",55,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"Typically the corrected sample standard deviation (using N−1) is used and referred to as the sample standard deviation.",30,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"Other estimators may be better: the uncorrected estimator (using N) lowers MSE, and using N−1.5 nearly eliminates bias for normal data.",29,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"The population standard deviation formula can be applied to a sample by treating the sample size as the population size, even if the true population is larger.",44,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"The estimator s_N is known as the uncorrected sample standard deviation or the sample's standard deviation as if the sample were the whole population.",26,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"It is defined as s_N = sqrt((1/N) Σ (x_i – x̄)^2).",13,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"The observed sample values {x_i} and mean x̄ define the denominator N, making s_N the square root of the sample variance, the average squared deviation from the mean.",54,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
"s_N is a consistent estimator converging to the population value and is the maximum‑likelihood estimate for normally distributed populations.",32,5,2,5,1,1,5,5
