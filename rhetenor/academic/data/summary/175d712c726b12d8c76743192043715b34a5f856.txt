Regardless of direction and size, correction patterns in the market remain identical.  
Downward or sideways corrections are formed on the bullish part of the market, while on the bearish area they are ascending or sideways corrections.  
There are three levels of waves: Primary (Major), Intermediate, and Secondary (Minor).  
There are three levels of corrections corresponding to the three wave levels.  
There are three types of corrections: zigzag, wave flat, and triangle.  
The wave planes of the Secondary, Intermediate, and Primary levels and their inverted variants are called “plane” because their external shape is horizontal, sometimes sloped.  
These models can be called “3‑3‑5”; they are three‑wave patterns (A, B, C), while the bullish momentum pattern is a “5‑3‑5‑3‑5” pattern for waves 1‑5.  
Whether wave C of the wave plane is an extension or not, the pattern remains corrective.  
A sideways double correction can have seven waves.  
A sideways triple correction can have eleven waves.  
A sideways correction in an uptrend always ends in a down wave (2), whether it consists of one, three, seven, or eleven waves.  
Three‑wave corrections are called “single three,” seven‑wave corrections “double three,” and eleven‑wave corrections “triple three.”  
Triangles are made up of five waves (or five legs).  
In large patterns each segment consists of three waves.
