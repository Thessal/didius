Rollback occurs immediately at lower wave levels.,8,5,4,5,1,3,5,5
At intermediate or primary levels the double pass may not start until the up‑move is complete.,18,5,4,5,1,3,5,5
At high speed the same price area rolls back in the opposite direction at almost the same speed.,22,5,4,5,1,3,5,5
Impulse waves 1, 3 and 5 are rarely the same length.,13,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
One impulse wave is significantly longer than the other two.,10,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
Wave 3 is never shorter than both waves 1 and 5.,11,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
If wave 3 is shorter than wave 1 or 5, the correct counting is shown in Figure 50.,18,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
Wave 4 should not enter the territory of wave 1.,10,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
If wave 4 overlaps wave 1, the end of wave 4 is lower than the top of wave 1.,19,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
Inverted examples are shown in Figures 51‑52.,7,5,3,5,1,5,5,5
The overlap in the complex wave structure requires careful study.,10,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
Complex structures can form double threes or triple threes.,9,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
It is very important to plot daily values to determine if the first up‑move has three or five waves.,23,4,4,4,5,2,5,5
The weekly time frame may not reveal the exact structure of the first up‑wave.,14,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
Figures 53‑54 show an inverted wave flat on both daily and weekly charts.,13,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
The weekly frame may miss the first up‑wave structure, leading students to assume it had five waves on the daily chart.,28,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
The weekly inverted wave plane may appear to have seven waves, though its structure is A‑B‑(1‑5)‑C.,17,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
A similar situation can occur with a zigzag.,8,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
The zigzag does not lengthen but can double as it grows.,12,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
Whether a zigzag is single or double, its corrective characteristics remain the same.,13,4,4,4,1,3,5,5
All corrective movements, regardless of wave level, consist of three waves.,11,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
Lateral movements follow the same demeanor and are also corrective.,10,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
Figure 58 shows two types of sideways movements following an uptrend.,11,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
Figure 59 shows the main trend down.,7,5,4,5,1,5,5,5
Part of the extension in the first or third wave will be done twice, but not in the same manner as in the fifth wave.,25,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
Only after the extension in the fifth wave does the pull‑back reach the top of the second extension wave.,19,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
The wave level does not affect the models.,8,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
This refers to the top of the extended wave flat, supposedly followed by a double pass, resulting from Elliott's unusual marking of the 1928‑1930 period.,27,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
He means shorter than wave 1 and shorter than wave 5.,11,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
The same.,2,3,3,3,1,2,5,5
These patterns are hardly a wave plane in appearance; the general contour suggests a double zigzag.,16,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
The first example in Figures 58‑59 is a wave plane; the second shows the appearance of a certain wave plane on a larger time frame.,26,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
A move that exceeds the top of the fifth wave (OT – orthodox top) is the top of the extended wave flat.,22,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
Suppose the five up‑waves in Figure 61 are at the prior level.,12,3,3,3,1,2,5,5
