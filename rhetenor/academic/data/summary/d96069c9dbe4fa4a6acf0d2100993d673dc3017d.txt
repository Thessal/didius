The MACD period settings (12, 26, 9) correspond to two weeks, one month, and one and a half weeks respectively.  
Because trading weeks have only five days, the possibility of adjusting the period settings cannot be ignored.  
It is advisable to use the period settings that most traders use, since decisions based on standard settings tend to push prices in that direction.  
Although MACD and its average series are discrete values, they are typically displayed as continuous lines on a time‑axis plot, while the divergence is shown as a bar chart (histogram).  
A fast exponential moving average (EMA) reacts more quickly than a slow EMA to recent changes in a stock’s price.  
Comparing EMAs of different periods allows the MACD series to indicate changes in a stock’s trend.  
The MACD divergence series can reveal subtle shifts in a stock’s trend.  
Because it is based on moving averages, the MACD is a lagging indicator.  
The MACD is less useful for stocks that are not trending, are trading in a range, or exhibit unpredictable price action.  
Consequently, trends are often already completed or nearly finished by the time the MACD signals the trend.  
In MACD terminology, “divergence” refers to the two underlying moving averages drifting apart, while “convergence” refers to them moving toward each other.  
Gerald Appel defined a divergence as a situation where the MACD line does not conform to the price movement, such as a price low not being accompanied by a low in the MACD.  
Thomas Asprey called the difference between the MACD line and its signal line the “divergence” series.  
Gerald Appel described the bar‑graph plot of the basic MACD time series as a “histogram,” where the bar height corresponds to the MACD value at each point in time.  
The difference between the MACD line and its signal line is often plotted as a bar chart and referred to as a histogram.
