The MACD parameters (12, 26, 9) correspond to approximately two weeks, one month, and one and a half weeks of trading data.  
Because trading weeks consist of five days, the period settings may need to be adjusted.  
It is generally better to use the period settings that most traders use, since buying and selling decisions based on standard settings can reinforce price movements.  
Although MACD and average series are discrete values, they are typically displayed as continuous lines over time, while the divergence is shown as a histogram bar chart.  
A fast exponential moving average (EMA) reacts more quickly to recent price changes than a slow EMA.  
Comparing EMAs of different periods allows the MACD to indicate changes in a stock’s trend.  
The divergence series is claimed to reveal subtle shifts in a stock’s trend.  
The MACD is a lagging indicator because it is based on moving averages.  
The MACD is less useful for stocks that are not trending, are range‑bound, or exhibit unpredictable price action.  
By the time the MACD signals a trend, the trend may already be largely completed.  
In MACD terminology, “divergence” refers to the two underlying moving averages moving apart, while “convergence” refers to them moving together.  
Gerald Appel defined divergence as a situation where the MACD line does not conform to price movement, such as a price low not accompanied by a MACD low.  
Thomas Asprey called the difference between the MACD line and its signal line the “divergence” series.  
In a MACD histogram, the height of each bar corresponds to the MACD value at that point in time.  
The difference between the MACD line and its signal line is often plotted as a bar chart and called a histogram.
