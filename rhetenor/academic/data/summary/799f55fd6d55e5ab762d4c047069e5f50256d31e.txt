In Appel's histogram the bar height corresponds to the MACD value at a given point in time.  
The difference between the MACD and its signal line is often plotted as a bar chart called a histogram.  
The MACD line is calculated as the 12‑period exponential moving average minus the 26‑period exponential moving average of closing prices.  
The signal line is the 9‑period exponential moving average of the MACD line.  
In signal‑processing terms, the MACD series is a low‑pass‑filtered measure of the derivative of the price series with respect to time.  
MACD estimates the price derivative by applying two low‑pass filters in tandem and multiplying by a gain equal to the difference in their time constants.  
MACD can also be viewed as approximating the derivative using a single exponential filter whose time constant equals the sum of the two filter time constants, multiplied by the same gain.  
With standard MACD parameters (12‑day and 26‑day EMA), the derivative estimate is approximately filtered by a 38‑day low‑pass EMA.  
The per‑day time‑derivative estimate equals the MACD value divided by 14.  
The average series is also a derivative estimate that includes an additional low‑pass filter, resulting in extra lag.  
The difference between the MACD series and the average series (the divergence series) measures the second derivative of price (acceleration) with respect to time.  
This second‑derivative estimate has additional lag from the signal filter and an extra gain factor equal to the signal filter constant.  
The MACD is classified as an absolute price oscillator because it uses the actual price values of moving averages rather than percentage changes.  
A percentage price oscillator computes the difference between two moving averages divided by the longer moving average value.  
An absolute price oscillator shows larger values for higher‑priced securities and smaller values for lower‑priced securities, whereas a percentage price oscillator expresses changes relative to price.
