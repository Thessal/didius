"The McClellan oscillator is a market breadth indicator used in technical analysis by financial analysts of the New York Stock Exchange to evaluate the balance between the advancing and declining stocks.",31,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"The McClellan oscillator is based on the Advance-Decline Data and it could be applied to stock market exchanges, indexes, portfolio of stocks or any basket of stocks.",27,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Advances is the number of the NYSE listed stocks which are traded above their previous day close.",17,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Declines is the number of the NYSE listed stocks traded below their previous day close.",15,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Difference between advances and declines shows whether we have more advancing or more declining stocks on the NYSE.",18,4,5,4,1,2,5,5
"Dominance of the advancing stocks is considered as bullish Breadth sentiment.",11,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"Higher number of declining stocks is considered as bearish Breadth sentiment.",11,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"Applying 19-day and 39-day EMAs to the difference between advances and declines defines shorter-term (19-day) and longer-term (39-day) Breadth sentiment.",20,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Calculating the McClellan Oscillator as the difference between the 19-day EMA and 39-day EMA of advances minus declines applies the MACD principle to Breadth sentiment to see changes in shorter-term Breadth sentiment.",32,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Crossovers of the McClellan Oscillator and the zero center line around which it oscillates have specific meanings.",17,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"When the McClellan Oscillator crosses above the zero line, it indicates that the 19-day EMA of advances minus declines has crossed above the 39-day EMA of advances minus declines, suggesting a possible up-move in the NYSE index.",37,4,5,4,1,2,5,5
"When the McClellan Oscillator crosses below the zero line, it indicates that the 19-day EMA of advances minus declines has crossed below the 39-day EMA of advances minus declines, suggesting a possible down-move in the NYSE index.",37,4,5,4,1,2,5,5
"The McClellan Summation Index (MSI) is calculated by adding each day's McClellan oscillator to the previous day's summation index.",19,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"When the MSI is above zero it is considered bullish (positive growth).",12,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"When the MSI is below zero it is considered bearish (negative growth).",12,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"The summation index is oversold at –1000 to –1250 or overbought at 1000 to 1250.",15,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"The McClellan oscillator equals the 19-day EMA of advances minus declines minus the 39-day EMA of advances minus declines.",19,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
