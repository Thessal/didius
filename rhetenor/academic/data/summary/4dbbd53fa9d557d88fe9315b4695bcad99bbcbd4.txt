"Figure 6.1 starts on Day 10 with a closing price of 48.50.",14,5,2,2,1,5,5,5
"Price on Day 1 (ten days earlier) was 50.75.",10,5,2,2,1,5,5,5
"Using a ten‑day oscillator, subtract the price ten days ago (50.75) from today's price (48.50) to get an oscillator value of -2.25.",25,5,3,5,1,2,5,5

"The hypothetically generated oscillator curve is noted as very interesting.",11,4,2,2,1,1,5,5
"When price declines uniformly from Days 10‑14, the oscillator curve remains a horizontal line.",23,5,3,5,1,2,5,5
"On Day 15 the price rises 25 points while the oscillator rises 50 points.",18,5,2,3,1,5,5,5
"Oscillator increases at double the rate of the price.",10,5,2,4,1,2,5,5
"Oscillator maintains its rate until Day 23 when it stabilizes, while price keeps rising at the same pace.",26,5,3,4,1,2,5,5

"Oscillator seems one step ahead of price because it measures price’s rate of change.",28,4,3,4,1,2,5,5
"From Days 14‑23, oscillator indicates a very fast price change as price direction shifts from down to up.",29,5,2,4,1,5,5,5
"When price ten days prior bottoms and rises, the rate of change decelerates as changes occur in a single direction.",31,4,3,4,1,2,5,5
"Oscillator is a valuable technical tool for knowledgeable traders, but three problems arise in creating a meaningful oscillator.",27,4,3,2,1,1,5,5
