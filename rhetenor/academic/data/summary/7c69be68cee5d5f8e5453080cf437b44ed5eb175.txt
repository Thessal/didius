Up until 1906, the Dow railroad index outperformed the DJIA industrial index.  
From 1906 to 1940, the Dow industrial index led the upward movement for 34 years.  
Since 1940, the railway index has again been in the lead.  
An arithmetic scale should always be used until a logarithmic scale is required.  
During an upward five‑wave move, a semi‑logarithmic scale is required when the price moves above the parallel line.  
Wave 1 of the triangle from 1928 to 1932 consists of waves A, B, and C.  
Wave A consists of three down waves from November to December 1928.  
Wave B, in the form of an inverted wave flat, forms the top of an extended wave flat of a higher level.  
Wave C, lasting 34 months, consists of five downward waves from September 1929 to July 1932.  
Wave 2 of the triangle from 1932 to 1937 is a typical bullish pattern consisting of five waves.  
Wave 2 lasted five years.  
Wave 3 of the triangle was a descending five‑wave and lasted 13 months.  
Waves 1, 2, and 3 of the triangle from November 1928 to March 1938 constitute the wave plane.  
Wave 4 of the triangle from 1938 to 1939 is an inverted zigzag.  
Wave 5 of the triangle from 1939 to April 1942 is a wave flat.
