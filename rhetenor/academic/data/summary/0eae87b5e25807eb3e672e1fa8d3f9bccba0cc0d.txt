"The uncorrected sample standard deviation is the maximum‑likelihood estimate for a normal population.",13,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Bias decreases with sample size, dropping as 1/N, and is below 1% for N > 75.",14,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"For very large samples the uncorrected sample standard deviation is generally acceptable.",12,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"This estimator has a uniformly smaller mean squared error than the corrected sample standard deviation.",15,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Using the biased sample variance gives s_N = sqrt(1/N ∑(x_i‑x̄)²) as an estimate of the population standard deviation.",17,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Taking the square root introduces additional downward bias because the square root is a concave function (Jensen’s inequality).",18,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"The variance bias is easy to correct, but bias from the square root is harder and depends on the distribution.",20,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Applying Bessel’s correction (using N‑1) yields the unbiased sample variance s² = 1/(N‑1) ∑(x_i‑x̄)².",13,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"The unbiased variance estimator requires that the variance exists and samples are drawn independently with replacement.",16,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"N‑1 equals the degrees of freedom in the vector of deviations from the mean.",14,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Taking square roots reintroduces bias, giving the corrected sample standard deviation s = sqrt(1/(N‑1) ∑(x_i‑x̄)²).",14,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Although s² is unbiased for variance, s remains a biased estimator for the population standard deviation, though less biased than the uncorrected version.",23,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"This estimator is commonly used and known as the sample standard deviation.",12,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"The bias can be large for small samples (N < 10).",9,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"As sample size increases, the amount of bias decreases.",9,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
