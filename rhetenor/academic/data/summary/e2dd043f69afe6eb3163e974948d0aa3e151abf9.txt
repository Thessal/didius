The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator in technical analysis that uses support and resistance levels as an oscillator.  
George Lane developed the stochastic oscillator indicator in the late 1950s.  
In the stochastic oscillator, the term “stochastic” refers to the position of the current price relative to its price range over a period of time.  
The stochastic oscillator method attempts to predict price turning points by comparing a security’s closing price to its price range.  
The 5‑period stochastic %K is calculated as %K = 100 × (Price – Low_5) / (High_5 – Low_5).  
The %D_N is the N‑day moving average of %K, computed as %D_N = (%K_1 + %K_2 + … + %K_N) / N.  
High_5 and Low_5 are the highest and lowest prices in the last five days, respectively.  
% D is typically calculated as a simple moving average of %K, but it can also be an exponential moving average.
