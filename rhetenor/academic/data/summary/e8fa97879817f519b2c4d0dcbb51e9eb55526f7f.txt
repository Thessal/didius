An investment of $1,000 in the stock market in July 1932 would have grown to about $5,000 by March 1937, excluding dividends, based on percentage changes of popular indexes.  
The primary factor in trading stocks is timing—when to buy and sell.  
The next most important factor in stock trading is the choice of stocks to trade.  
Market price fluctuations of any security are much larger than its annual dividend income.  
Bull markets consist of five primary waves lasting about two years, with different index groups forming tops at different times.  
The duration of a bear market is generally longer than the duration of the preceding bull market.  
During the sharp decline from 1929 to 1932, both the best and inferior stocks and bonds were forced to be sold regardless of their true value.  
Many traders mistakenly believe that all bear‑market declines can repeat with the same parameters.  
Studies indicate that many years will pass before another deep market fall of that magnitude can be expected.  
The final bottom of bear markets occurs simultaneously across almost all index groups, opposite to the simultaneous highs of bull markets.  
During bull markets, superiority among stocks is less pronounced, especially during long rallies.  
During bear periods, the overall market and several groups become more sensitive to current events and external factors.  
Prior bad trading experiences can cause traders to become prejudiced against individual stocks, making it difficult to find flaw‑free stock groups.  
Stocks that are sluggishly or infrequently traded should be avoided because wave patterns do not form.  
Confidential information from well‑wishers usually concerns thinly traded or cheap stocks; it is advisable to trade only widely traded stocks.  
The stock life cycle has three stages: a juvenile stage where stocks should be avoided, a creative stage where stocks have flourished and are excellent for trading, and a later stage.
