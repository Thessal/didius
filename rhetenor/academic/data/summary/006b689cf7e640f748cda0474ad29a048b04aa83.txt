Triangles are made up of five waves (or five legs).  
In large patterns each segment consists of three waves.  
On medium-sized specimens the fourth and fifth legs may be one wave each.  
On small specimens the legs often consist of only one wave.  
The main reference point in the formation of a triangle is the generators—straight lines drawn through its vertices.  
You cannot be sure a triangle is forming until the fifth wave begins.  
The fifth segment can end within or outside the triangle generators.  
The fifth wave of the triangle may end outside the generators, but not beyond the top of the third wave.  
An extension can form in any one of the three impulses (waves 1, 3 or 5), but never in more than one.  
In each example the total number of waves is nine if the extension is counted as five waves instead of one.  
In rare cases an extended move can consist of nine waves of equal size.  
Extensions are formed only in the new price territory of the current cycle; they are not formed as corrections.  
The extensions “pass twice” along the price segment: the correction traverses the same segment twice—down and up.  
This feature is relevant only when the extension develops in the fifth wave.  
If an extension is formed at lower wave levels, the rollback occurs immediately.  
At intermediate or primary (major) levels the double pass may not start until the entire up‑move is complete.  
When the move is at high speed the same price area rolls back in the opposite direction at almost the same speed.
