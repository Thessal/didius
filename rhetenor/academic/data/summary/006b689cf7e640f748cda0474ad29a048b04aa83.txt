Triangles are composed of five waves (or five legs).  
In large patterns each segment of a triangle consists of three waves.  
In medium-sized triangles the fourth and fifth legs may each be a single wave.  
In small triangles the legs often consist of only one wave each.  
The main reference point in forming a triangle is the generator lines drawn through its vertices.  
A triangle cannot be confirmed until the fifth wave begins.  
The fifth segment of a triangle can end within or outside the triangle generators.  
The fifth wave of a triangle may end outside the generators, but not beyond the top of the third wave.  
An extension can form in only one of the three impulse waves (waves 1, 3, or 5), never in more than one.  
When an extension is counted as five waves instead of one, the total number of waves in the pattern becomes nine.  
In rare cases an extended move can consist of nine waves of equal size.  
Extensions are formed only in new price territory of the current cycle and are not formed as corrections.  
Extensions pass twice along the same price segment, with the correction traversing the segment down and up.  
The double-pass feature of extensions is relevant only when the extension develops in the fifth wave.  
If an extension forms in the first wave, a double pass appears in waves 2‑3; if in the third wave, in waves 4‑5; if in the fifth wave, it appears as described in Figure 48.  
When an extension forms at lower wave levels, the rollback occurs immediately.  
At intermediate or primary (major) levels, the double pass may not start until the entire up‑move is complete.  
When the move is at high speed, the same price area rolls back in the opposite direction at almost the same speed.
