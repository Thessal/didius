"A weighted average assigns different multiplying factors to data points based on their positions in the sample window.",23,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"The weighted moving average is mathematically the convolution of the data with a fixed weighting function.",16,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"One application of weighted averaging is removing pixelization from digital images.",10,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"This technique is also known as anti-aliasing.",6,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"In finance, a weighted moving average uses weights that decrease in arithmetic progression.",19,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"In an n‑day WMA, the most recent day has weight n, the next has n‑1, down to one.",18,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"The denominator of the WMA formula is the triangular number n(n+1)/2.",9,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"When updating WMA values, the numerator difference equals n p_{M+1} minus the sum of the previous n data points.",25,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"If the sum of the last n data points is called Total_M, then Total_{M+1}=Total_M + p_{M+1} – p_{M‑n+1}.",20,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"The numerator for the next period equals the previous numerator plus n p_{M+1} minus Total_M.",8,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"WMA_{M+1} equals its numerator divided by the sum of the weights.",9,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"The graph shows weights decreasing from the highest for the most recent data down to zero.",18,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"These weights can be compared to those of the exponential moving average.",12,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"An exponential moving average (EMA), also called an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), is a first‑order IIR filter whose weighting factors decrease exponentially.",28,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"Each older datum’s weighting factor decreases exponentially and never reaches zero.",11,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
"This formulation is attributed to Hunter (1986).",7,5,2,5,1,2,5,5
