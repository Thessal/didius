"The standard error of the mean equals the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, and is estimated using the sample standard deviation similarly.",39,5,3,5,1,2,5,4
"A poll's standard error, reported as its margin of error, is the expected standard deviation of the estimated mean across repeated polls.",34,5,3,5,1,2,5,4
"Standard error estimates the standard deviation of an estimate, reflecting how much the estimate depends on the specific sample.",29,5,3,5,1,2,5,4
"In science it is common to report both the data's standard deviation and the estimate's standard error.",34,4,4,4,1,2,4,4
"By convention effects more than two standard errors from the null are deemed statistically significant to guard against random sampling error.",31,4,4,4,1,2,3,4
"Suppose the entire population of interest consists of eight students in a class.",14,2,3,3,1,1,1,2
"The students' marks are 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, and 9.",15,5,3,5,1,5,5,2
"Population standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the average of squared deviations from the mean.",32,5,3,5,1,2,2,4
"The eight data points have a mean of 5.",10,5,3,5,1,5,5,2
"Variance is the mean of the squared deviations.",8,5,3,5,1,2,2,4
"σ equals the square root of the average of (v minus μ) squared for each value v, where μ is the average of the values.",15,5,3,5,1,2,2,4
"σ squared equals (9+1+1+1+0+0+4+16)/8, which simplifies to 4.",25,5,3,5,1,2,2,4
