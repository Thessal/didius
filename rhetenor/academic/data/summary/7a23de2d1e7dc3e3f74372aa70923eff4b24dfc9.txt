The A‑D Line correctly indicated a divergent top before a 27 % decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1962.  
Peter N. Haurlan was among the first people to use a computer for technical analysis of stock market data.  
Haurlan was the first to employ exponential moving averages (EMAs) of price and breadth data in stock market analysis.  
An EMA differs from a simple moving average because it weights more recent data more heavily using a smoothing constant.  
A 10 % smoothing‑constant EMA counts today’s price as 10 % and yesterday’s EMA value as 90 % in the calculation.  
Haurlan referred to a 10 % smoothing‑constant EMA as a “10 % Trend” and a 5 % smoothing‑constant EMA as a “5 % Trend”.  
Haurlan advocated using smoothing constants of 1 %, 2 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 50 % for stock market analysis.  
Haurlan encoded stock prices onto IBM punch cards and processed them on JPL’s computer during off‑hours.
