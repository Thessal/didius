The A‑D Line correctly indicated a divergent top compared to stock prices at the 1961 top, just ahead of a 27% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1962.  
Peter N. Haurlan was among the first people to use a computer for technical analysis of stock market data.  
Haurlan was the first to employ exponential moving averages (EMAs) of price and breadth data in stock market analysis.  
An exponential moving average (EMA) differs from a simple moving average (SMA) because it weights more recent data more heavily.  
An EMA using a 10% smoothing constant counts today’s price as 10% and yesterday’s EMA value as 90% in calculating today’s EMA.  
Haurlan referred to a 10% EMA as a “10% Trend” and a 5% EMA as a “5% Trend.”  
Haurlan advocated using a variety of smoothing constant values (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%) for stock market analysis.  
Haurlan encoded stock prices onto IBM punch cards and processed them on JPL’s computer during off‑hours.  
Haurlan’s pamphlet “Measuring Trend Values” outlined techniques for calculating and interpreting EMAs.
