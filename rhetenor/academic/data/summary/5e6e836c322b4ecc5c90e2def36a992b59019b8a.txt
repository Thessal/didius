"Haurlan's pamphlet is included in Part II of the booklet",16,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"He outlined EMA calculation and interpretation techniques in the pamphlet",11,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"Technical analysis community shifted from original terminology to time-period based moving averages",42,4,4,2,1,3,5,4
"Smoothing constant formula is 2/(n+1) where n is number of days",19,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"19-day EMA corresponds to 10% trend with calculation 2+(19+1)=0.10",25,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"We continue using Haurlan's original terminology despite global preference for day-based references",25,4,4,2,1,3,5,4
"Reason for using original terminology is respect for original work and because day count is misleading",24,4,4,2,1,2,5,4
"In SMA only data within lookback period influences the moving average value",27,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"In 50-day SMA, the 51st day has no effect and the 50th day contributes equally to yesterday's data",27,5,1,5,1,5,5,4
"EMA retains all past days but influence fades, making day count labels misleading",44,5,1,5,1,5,5,4

"By 1969 Haurlan was using EMAs to analyze breadth data",11,5,1,3,1,3,5,4
"Sherman and Marian added insight of calculating difference between 10% and 5% EMA trends of daily breadth",30,5,1,3,1,3,5,4
"This method gave a different perspective compared to individual EMA indications",18,4,3,2,1,3,5,4
"The method is mathematically similar to MACD, which uses SMAs instead of EMAs",32,4,1,3,1,3,5,4
