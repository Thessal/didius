Ease of Movement (EMV) is an indicator used in technical analysis to relate an asset's price change to its volume.  
Ease of Movement was developed by Richard W. Arms, Jr.  
High positive EMV values indicate the price is increasing on low volume.  
Strong negative EMV values indicate the price is dropping on low volume.  
The moving average of the EMV indicator can be added to act as a trigger line, similar to other indicators like the MACD.  
Ease of Movement calculates how easily a price can move up or down, based on momentum.  
The calculation subtracts yesterday's average price from today's average price and divides the difference by volume.
