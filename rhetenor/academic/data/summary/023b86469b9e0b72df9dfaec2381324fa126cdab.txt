"The term 'Major' is used by Elliott as a substitute for 'Primary' introduced in the first monograph.",26,5,4,4,1,5,5,2

"Regardless of direction and size, the correction patterns remain identical.",10,5,4,5,1,5,5,2
"Downward or sideways corrections are formed on the bullish part of the market; on the bearish area, ascending or sideways corrections.",21,5,4,5,1,5,5,2
"Schematic drawings of corrections are presented for both bullish and bearish sections of the market.",15,5,3,4,1,5,5,2
"The schematic corrections shown first refer to rising market segments; subsequent charts refer to descending sections and are 'flipped'.",19,5,3,4,1,5,5,2
"Where the expression 'inverted' occurs, it refers to a downtrend in the main trend.",14,5,3,4,1,5,5,2
"There are three levels of waves: Primary (Major), Intermediate (Intermediate) and Secondary (Minor).",13,5,4,4,1,5,5,2
"There are also three levels of corrections.",7,5,4,4,1,5,5,2
"There are three types of corrections: zigzag, wave flat and triangle.",11,5,4,4,1,5,5,2
"These schematic representations are called 'plane' because their usual external shape is horizontal; at times they have a downward or upward slope.",22,5,3,4,1,5,5,2
"These models could be called '3-3-5'.",6,4,4,3,1,4,5,2
"According to recent studies, they are three-wave patterns (A, B, C), while the bullish pattern (momentum) is a '5-3-5-3-5' pattern for waves 1-5.",23,4,4,4,1,4,5,2
"The human model is '5-3-5-3'.",5,4,4,4,1,4,5,2
"Five protruding parts depart from the torso (head, two arms and two legs); arms and legs are divided into three parts; the ends of the arms and legs are divided into five fingers; each finger (except the big toe) is again divided into three parts.",45,5,3,4,1,5,5,2
"Whether wave C of the wave plane will be an extension or not, the pattern will remain corrective.",18,4,4,4,1,4,5,2
"Whether an extension will form in wave C can be found out by carefully reading Chapter 8, 'Alternations'.",18,4,4,4,1,4,5,2
"Correction at the Secondary wave level (Minor) can consist of three waves.",12,4,4,4,1,5,5,2
"A sideways double correction can have seven waves.",8,4,4,4,1,5,5,2
"A sideways triple correction can have eleven waves.",8,4,4,4,1,5,5,2
"A sideways correction in an uptrend always ends in a down wave (2), whether it consists of one, three, seven or eleven waves.",23,5,4,5,1,5,5,2
"They are called: three waves - 'single three', seven waves - 'double three', eleven waves - 'triple three'.",18,5,4,4,1,5,5,2
"The same number of upward waves, as shown in Figures 24-26, is corrective.",13,4,4,4,1,5,5,2
