"Standard deviation measures variation of values around the mean.",22,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"Low standard deviation means values are close to the mean; high indicates they are spread over a wider range.",39,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"Standard deviation is abbreviated SD or std dev.",41,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"Population standard deviation is denoted by sigma (σ); sample standard deviation by s.",22,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"Standard deviation equals the square root of variance for a random variable, sample, population, data set, or distribution.",22,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"For a finite population, variance is the average of squared deviations from the mean.",15,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"Standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the data, unlike variance.",22,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"Standard deviation can be used to calculate standard error for a finite sample.",19,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"Standard deviation can be used to determine statistical significance.",19,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"The term 'standard deviation of the sample' may refer to the direct sample deviation or an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation.",57,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"Standard deviation of a population/sample and standard error of a statistic are different but related.",25,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"The sample mean's standard error is the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means from infinite repeated samples.",36,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
"The mean's standard error equals the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size and is estimated using the sample.",28,5,4,4,1,3,5,5
