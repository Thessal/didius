The ADXR is the final number used to rate all commodities, currencies, stocks, etc., on a scale indicative of directional movement.  
ADXR is calculated as the average of today’s ADX and the ADX from 14 days ago: ADXR = (ADX_today + ADX_14_days_ago) / 2.  
The ADXR should reflect good directional movement while exhibiting minimal fluctuation at equilibrium points.  
When plotted, the ADX tends to form a sine‑like curve whose amplitude is measured from the zero line, with peaks and valleys indicating changes of direction.  
Higher amplitude of the ADX curve reflects stronger directional movement in one direction, indicating a strong trend.  
Larger distances between ADX peaks and valleys produce stronger reactions to the trend, which can be profitable in both directions.  
Good directional movement includes movement that exceeds the equilibrium point, which occurs when +DI14 equals –DI14.  
When the ADXR is less than 20, directional movement is typical; when the ADXR is above 25, equilibrium points widen.
