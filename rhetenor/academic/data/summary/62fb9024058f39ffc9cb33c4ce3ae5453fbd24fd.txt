The ADXR rates commodities, currencies, stocks, etc., on a scale indicative of directional movement.  
ADXR is calculated as (ADX_today + ADX_14_days_ago) / 2.  
ADXR is intended to indicate directional movement while exhibiting minimal fluctuation when direction changes.  
The ADX plotted over time tends to form a sine‑like curve.  
The amplitude of the ADX curve, measured from the zero line, has peaks and valleys that indicate changes of direction.  
In a downtrend, ADX peaks correspond to low price points and valleys to high price points; in an uptrend, peaks correspond to high price points and valleys to low price points.  
Higher ADX amplitude reflects stronger directional movement in one direction, indicating a strong trend.  
Larger distances between ADX peaks and valleys produce stronger reactions to the trend, which can be profitable in both directions.  
ADXR reflects good directional movement but should not fluctuate excessively at equilibrium points.  
ADXR achieves stability by averaging a 14‑day differential of the ADX.  
Good directional movement includes movement that exceeds the equilibrium point, not just straight‑up or straight‑down movement.  
The equilibrium point is reached when +DI14 equals –DI14.  
Low ADX values correspond to price swings around equilibrium points.  
Higher ADX values correspond to larger distances between equilibrium points.  
Very high ADX values can occur when an equilibrium point is reached only once.  
When the distance between equilibrium points is zero, buying at the first point and selling at the second would break even, while other trades may result in a loss.  
Directional movement can exist when there is a distance between equilibrium points.  
ADXR values typically below 20 indicate limited directional movement.  
ADXR values above 25 indicate widening equilibrium points.  
High directional movement relative to a 14‑day period causes equilibrium points to occur immediately after a turn rather than halfway up the next swing.
