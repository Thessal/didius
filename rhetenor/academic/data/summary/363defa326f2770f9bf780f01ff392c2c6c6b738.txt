"The Market moves upward or downward, composed of a succession of complex structures briefly interrupted by simple structures.",20,5,3,3,1,3,5,3
"When complex structures give way to a simple structure, it may indicate the trending side is ready to relinquish control, allowing the opposite side to take over.",46,4,4,3,1,2,5,4
"If neither side forms a complex structure, both bulls and bears are equally hesitant to assume control.",22,4,4,3,1,2,5,4
"The Oscillator forms trendlines like price charts, but its trendlines usually break before the corresponding price trendlines.",31,5,2,5,1,5,5,5
"Breaking of an Oscillator trendline signals a reversal of the prevailing short‑term trend.",27,5,2,5,1,5,5,5
"An Oscillator trendline break precedes the break of the equivalent price trendline.",24,5,2,5,1,5,5,5
"It is important to be careful when drawing lines and especially when drawing conclusions from them.",18,5,3,4,4,4,5,5
"Longer‑period trendlines become less meaningful; it is better to use steeper trendlines spanning three to six weeks.",25,4,4,4,4,3,5,5

"The McClellan Oscillator can provide significant insight if one is willing to listen.",14,3,4,3,1,2,5,4
"To hear the Oscillator’s message, one must use a chart of its movements rather than focus only on the numeric value.",22,5,3,4,4,3,5,5
"The Oscillator is calculated from daily closing values of NYSE advancing‑declining issues and is not an intraday indicator.",28,5,2,5,1,5,5,5
"It is possible to compute a ‘what‑if’ intraday Oscillator by treating intraday advance‑decline numbers as closing values.",36,4,4,4,1,3,5,4
"Other data can also be used to calculate McClellan Oscillators.",12,4,4,4,1,3,5,4
"We calculate breadth versions of the Oscillator from various market data sets, including Nasdaq, Nasdaq‑100, Dow 30, corporate bonds, and filtered NYSE common‑only stocks.",63,5,2,5,1,5,5,5
"It is possible to create a McClellan Oscillator from any breadth statistic, such as a stock portfolio or a sector‑wide subset.",41,4,4,4,1,3,5,4
"Subset breadth statistics tend to behave homogeneously.",19,5,2,5,1,5,5,5
