If prices stay up when the volume subsides for a number of days, such a move is considered “good”.  
If the market holds its own on negative volume days after advancing on positive volume, the market is in a strong position.  
PVI is called the “majority” curve.  
The majority tends to emulate the minority, but its timing is not as sharp as that of the minority.  
When the majority shows an appetite for stocks, the PVI is usually “into new high ground,” as in 1961.  
The two indicators assume that “smart” money trades on quiet (low‑volume) days and the crowd trades on very active days.  
The Negative Volume Index (NVI) picks out days when volume is lower than the previous day, and the Positive Volume Index (PVI) picks out days with higher volume.  
Whenever the NVI rises above a prior high while the DJIA is trending up, it gives a “Bull Market Signal.”  
When the NVI falls below a prior low while the DJIA is trending down, it gives a “Bear Market Signal.”  
The PVI is interpreted in reverse of the NVI.  
Signals are most authentic when the NVI has moved sideways for a number of months in a relatively narrow range.  
There is no mathematical system devoid of judgment that will continuously work without error in the stock market.  
Between 1946 and 1967, the NVI rendered 17 significant signals, of which 14 proved right (average gain of 4.32% from the final high or low) and 3 proved wrong (average loss of 6.33%).  
The NVI seriously erred in 1963‑1964 and in 1968.  
In 1969 Dysart reduced the weight given to the NVI because it was no longer a decisive indicator of the primary trend, though it retained an excellent ability to give leading indications of short‑term trend reversals.  
A probable reason for the NVI losing efficacy during the mid‑1960s may have been steadily higher NYSE daily volume due to a dramatic increase in the number of issues traded, causing prices to rise on declining volume.  
The NVI topped out in 1955 and trended down until at least 1968, although the DJIA moved higher during that period.  
Norman G. Fosback attributed the long‑term increase in the number of issues traded as a reason for a downward bias in a cumulative advance‑decline line.
