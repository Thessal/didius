"DPO is a technical indicator that removes long-term trends using a displaced moving average, avoiding reaction to current price action.",37,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"It enables the indicator to effectively show intermediate overbought and oversold levels.",12,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"DPO is a type of price oscillator, related to PPO and APO, which are forms of Gerald Appel's MACD.",34,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"APO equals MACD, while PPO is an improved alternative for large price changes or comparing stocks with different prices.",46,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"Although uncommon for DPO, other oscillators often add a signal line generated by EMA of oscillator values and plot both lines.",47,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"A histogram can also be generated for price oscillators, similar to MACD.",20,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"William Blau developed the DPO in 1991.",8,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"DPO is calculated by subtracting the SMA over n days, shifted (n/2+1) days back, from the price.",27,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"Decide the time frame to analyze.",10,5,2,4,5,1,5,5
"Set n as half of the cycle period.",8,5,2,4,5,1,5,5
"Calculate a simple moving average for n periods.",8,5,2,4,5,1,5,5
"Calculate (n/2+1).",6,5,2,4,5,1,5,5
"Subtract the SMA from (n/2+1) periods ago from the closing price.",16,5,2,4,5,1,5,5
"DPO compares current price with an earlier average price as its formula indicates.",21,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"When DPO crosses zero, the current price equals the price from that earlier time.",22,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"Trend change can be assessed based on whether the cross is from below or above.",18,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"A price-DPO divergence suggests the current trend is weaker than the SMA trend.",24,5,3,5,1,1,5,1
"DPO can assess price cycles, typical high/low values, and their duration.",25,5,3,4,1,1,5,3
"DPO applies to spot and futures markets but not to option price analysis.",19,5,3,4,1,1,5,3
