The detrended price oscillator (DPO) is a technical analysis indicator that eliminates long-term trends by using a displaced moving average, allowing it to show intermediate overbought and oversold levels.  
The DPO is a form of price oscillator, related to the percentage price oscillator (PPO) and absolute price oscillator (APO), which are variants of Gerald Appel's MACD indicator.  
The APO is equivalent to the MACD indicator, while the PPO is an improved alternative for stocks with large price changes or for comparing oscillators across stocks with significantly different prices.  
For price oscillators such as the DPO, a signal line is often generated by taking an exponential moving average of the oscillator values and plotting it together with the oscillator.  
A histogram can also be generated for price oscillators like the DPO, similar to the MACD indicator.  
The DPO was developed by William Blau in 1991.  
The DPO is calculated by subtracting the simple moving average over an n‑day period shifted (n/2 + 1) days back from the current price.  
To calculate the DPO, set n as half of the desired cycle period, compute the n‑period SMA, compute (n/2 + 1), and subtract the SMA from the closing price.  
The DPO compares the current price with the average price from (n/2 + 1) periods ago.  
When the DPO crosses the zero level, it indicates that the current price equals the price from (n/2 + 1) periods ago, and the direction of the cross signals a potential trend change.  
A divergence between price and the DPO suggests that the current trend is weaker than the trend indicated by the SMA.  
The DPO can be used to assess price cycles, their typical high and low values, and their duration in spot and futures markets.  
The DPO is applicable to all spot and futures markets but is not suitable for option price analysis.
