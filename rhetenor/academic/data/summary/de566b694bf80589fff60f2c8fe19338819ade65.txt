"Standard deviation formula: s(X)=√(N/(N-1))·√E[(X−E[X])²]",14,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"For a finite population with equal probabilities, σ = √[(1/N)∑(x_i−x̄)²] = √[(1/N)∑x_i²−x̄²]",38,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Standard deviation equals the square root of (average of squares minus square of average)",28,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Large standard deviation indicates data can spread far from the mean",15,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Small standard deviation indicates data are clustered closely around the mean",13,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Three example populations each have mean 7; their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1 respectively",23,5,5,5,5,1,5,5
"The third population’s standard deviation is much smaller because its values are close to 7",21,5,5,5,5,1,5,5
"Standard deviations have the same units as the original data points",12,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"If ages {0,6,8,14} represent four siblings, the standard deviation is 5 years",22,5,5,5,5,1,5,5
"If distances {1000,1006,1008,1014} represent four athletes, mean is 1007 m and SD is 5 m",27,5,5,5,5,1,5,5
"Standard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty",9,4,4,3,1,2,4,4
"In physical science, reported SD of repeated measurements gives their precision",19,5,5,5,4,1,4,5
"When assessing agreement with a theory, the SD of measurements is crucial",19,5,5,5,4,1,4,5
"If measurement mean is far from prediction in SD units, the theory probably needs revision",30,3,4,3,1,2,4,5
"This makes sense because values outside expected range indicate prediction may be incorrect",29,4,4,4,1,2,4,4
"Standard deviation measures typical deviation from mean, but other measures like mean absolute deviation exist",24,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
