"A moving average is a calculation that creates a series of averages from different selections of a full data set.",37,5,2,4,1,1,5,4
"Moving averages have simple, cumulative, and weighted variations.",7,5,2,4,1,1,5,4
"A moving average is mathematically a type of convolution.",9,5,2,4,1,1,5,4
"In signal processing, a moving average is viewed as a low‑pass finite impulse response filter.",14,5,2,4,1,1,5,4
"Because its filter coefficients follow a boxcar function, a moving average is called a boxcar filter.",14,5,2,4,1,1,5,4
"A moving average is sometimes followed by downsampling.",6,5,2,4,1,1,5,4
"The first element of a moving average is the average of the initial fixed subset of the series.",32,5,2,4,1,1,5,4

"Moving averages are used in economics to examine GDP, employment, and other macroeconomic time series.",17,5,2,4,1,1,5,4
"When applied to non‑time‑series data, a moving average filters higher‑frequency components without a specific time connection, assuming an implied ordering.",27,5,2,4,1,1,5,4
