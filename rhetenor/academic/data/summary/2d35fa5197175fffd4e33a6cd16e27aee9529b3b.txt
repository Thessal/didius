The ultimate oscillator is a theoretical concept in finance developed by Larry Williams to address problems of most oscillators when applied over different time lengths.  
The ultimate oscillator is a technical analysis indicator that measures buying or selling pressure based on where a day's closing price falls within the day's true range.  
Buying pressure for a day is calculated as the closing price minus the minimum of the day's low and the previous close.  
The true low for a day is the lesser of the day's trading low and the previous close.  
True range for a day is the maximum of the day's high and the previous close minus the minimum of the day's low and the previous close.  
The true high for a day is the greater of the day's trading high and the previous close.  
The total buying pressure over the past 7 days is expressed as a fraction of the total true range over the same 7‑day period.
