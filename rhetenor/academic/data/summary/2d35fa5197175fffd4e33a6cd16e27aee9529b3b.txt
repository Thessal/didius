The ultimate oscillator is a theoretical concept in finance developed by Larry Williams to address problems experienced in most oscillators when used over different lengths of time.  
The oscillator is a technical analysis indicator based on buying or selling pressure represented by where a day's closing price falls within the day's true range.  
Buying pressure is defined as the amount by which the close is above the true low on a given day, where true low is the lesser of the day's low and the previous close.  
True range is the difference between the true high and the true low, where true high is the greater of the day's high and the previous close.  
The total buying pressure over the past 7 days is expressed as a fraction of the total true range over the same period.
