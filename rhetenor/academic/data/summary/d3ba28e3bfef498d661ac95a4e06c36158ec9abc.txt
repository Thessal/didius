The DI DIFFERENCE (Column #14) is calculated as the difference between +DI14 and -DI14; in the example it equals 16.  
The sum of +DI14 and -DI14 (Column #15) represents the total directional range over the past 14 days; in the example it equals 56 (20 + 36).  
The Directional Movement Index (DX) is computed by dividing the DI DIFFERENCE by the sum of +DI14 and -DI14 and multiplying by 100, yielding a value that always lies between 0 and 100; in the example DX equals 29.  
A higher DX indicates stronger directional movement, while a lower DX indicates weaker directional movement, regardless of whether price moves up or down.  
When price moves straight up for 14 days and then straight down for 14 days, DX decreases as the price tops out and then increases again as the price continues down, reflecting strong directional movement in both directions.  
As price tops out and starts down, the difference between +DI14 and -DI14 decreases to zero and then increases again.  
During an uptrend, +DI14 is large and -DI14 is small; during a downtrend after the equilibrium point, -DI14 becomes larger and +DI14 smaller, causing the DI DIFFERENCE to increase again.  
To make DX indicative of both extreme up and down movements, the DX calculation period should be twice the period used for +DI14 and -DI14, which can be achieved by using a 14‑day average of DX.  
The Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) is calculated from the previous day's ADX after computing a 14‑day average of DX.  
A long position is taken when +DI14 crosses above -DI14, and a short position is taken when -DI14 crosses above +DI14, typically focusing on the top five or six commodities with the highest ADX values.  
On Day 16 (6/22/77), the True Range (TR14) was calculated as 42.98 using the formula TR14 = 43.32 – (43.42/14) + 2.75.  
On Day 16, the +DM14 was calculated as 8.19 using the formula +DM14 = 8.82 – (8.82/14) + 0.
