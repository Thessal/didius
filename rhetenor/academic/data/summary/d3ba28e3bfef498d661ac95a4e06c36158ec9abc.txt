The DI DIFFERENCE (Column #14) equals 16 in the given example.  
The sum of +DI14 and -DI14 (Column #15) represents the total directional range over the past 14 days; in the example it is 56 (20 + 36).  
The Directional Movement Index (DX) is calculated by dividing the DI DIFFERENCE by the sum of +DI14 and -DI14 and multiplying by 100, yielding a value that always lies between 0 and 100.  
A higher DX indicates more directional movement, while a lower DX indicates less directional movement, regardless of whether price moves up or down.  
When price moves straight up for 14 days and then straight down for 14 days, DX decreases as the price tops out and then increases again as the price continues down, reflecting strong directional movement in both directions.  
During an uptrend, +DI14 is large and -DI14 is small; during a downtrend after the equilibrium point, -DI14 increases and +DI14 decreases, causing the DI DIFFERENCE to increase again.  
To make DX indicative of both extreme up and down price movements, the DX calculation period should be twice the period used for +DI14 and -DI14, which can be achieved by using a 14‑day average of DX.  
The Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) is computed from the previous day's ADX after calculating a 14‑day average of DX.  
A long position is taken when +DI14 crosses above -DI14, and a short position is taken when -DI14 crosses above +DI14.  
Traders typically focus on the top five or six commodities with the highest ADX values.  
On Day 16, the True Range was 2.75, +DM was 0, and -DM was 1.75.  
The 14‑day True Range (TR14) for Day 16 was calculated as 42.98 using the formula TR14 = 43.32 − (43.42/14) + 2.75.  
The 14‑day positive directional movement (+DM14) for Day 16 was calculated as 8.19 using the formula +DM14 = 8.82 − (8.82/14) + 0.
