"Settings of (12, 26, 9) represent 2 weeks, 1 month and one and a half week.",16,5,2,2,1,3,5,1
"When trading weeks have only 5 days, possibilities of changing the period settings cannot be overruled.",16,4,3,4,1,2,5,1
"It is always better to stick to the period settings which are used by the majority of traders as the buying and selling decisions based on the standard settings further push the prices in that direction.",36,3,5,3,5,1,4,5
"Although the MACD and average series are discrete values in nature, they are customarily displayed as continuous lines in a plot whose horizontal axis is time, whereas the divergence is shown as a bar chart (often called a histogram).",39,5,2,2,1,3,5,1
"A fast EMA responds more quickly than a slow EMA to recent changes in a stock's price.",17,5,5,3,1,4,5,1
"By comparing EMAs of different periods, the MACD series can indicate changes in the trend of a stock.",18,4,5,4,1,3,5,2
"The divergence series can reveal subtle shifts in the stock's trend.",11,3,4,4,1,2,4,2
"Since the MACD is based on moving averages, it is a lagging indicator.",13,5,2,2,1,3,5,1
"As a future metric of price trends, the MACD is less useful for stocks that are not trending (trading in a range) or are trading with unpredictable price action.",29,3,4,3,1,2,4,2
"Hence the trends will already be completed or almost done by the time MACD shows the trend.",17,4,4,4,1,2,5,2
"Divergence refers to the two underlying moving averages drifting apart, while convergence refers to them coming towards each other.",19,5,1,1,1,1,5,1
"Gerald Appel referred to a \"divergence\" as the situation where the MACD line does not conform to the price movement, e.g., a price low is not accompanied by a low of the MACD.",33,5,1,1,1,1,5,1
"Thomas Asprey dubbed the difference between the MACD and its signal line the \"divergence\" series.",15,5,1,1,1,1,5,1
"In practice, definition number 2 above is often preferred.",9,4,3,3,1,1,4,2
"Gerald Appel referred to bar graph plots of the basic MACD time series as \"histogram\".",15,5,1,1,1,1,5,1
"In Appel's Histogram the height of the bar corresponds to the MACD value for a particular point in time.",19,5,1,1,1,1,5,1
"The difference between the MACD and its Signal line is often plotted as a bar chart and called a \"histogram\".",20,5,1,1,1,1,5,1
