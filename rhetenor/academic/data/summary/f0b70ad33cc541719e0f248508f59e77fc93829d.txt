The VIX index provides a measure of market volatility and reflects expectations of future stock market volatility.  
The current VIX index value quotes the expected annualized change in the S&P 500 index over the next 30 days, based on options theory and market data.  
VIX is a volatility index derived from S&P 500 options for the 30 days following the measurement date.  
Each option price used in the VIX calculation represents the market’s expectation of 30‑day forward‑looking volatility.  
The VIX calculation employs rules for selecting component options and a formula to calculate index values.  
VIX cannot be bought or sold directly.  
VIX is traded via derivative contracts, ETFs, and ETNs that most commonly track VIX futures indexes.  
CBOE uses the same methodology to compute volatility indexes for other markets, such as the Nasdaq‑100 Volatility Index (VXNSM), DJIA Volatility Index (VXDSM), and Russell 2000 Volatility Index (RVXSM).  
The VVIX measures the expected volatility of the 30‑day forward price of the VIX, i.e., volatility of volatility.  
The concept of computing implied volatility or an implied volatility index dates to the 1973 Black‑Scholes paper.
