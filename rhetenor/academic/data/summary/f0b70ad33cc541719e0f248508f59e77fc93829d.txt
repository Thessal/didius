The VIX index provides a measure of market volatility and expectations of further stock market volatility in the near future.  
The current VIX index value quotes the expected annualized change in the S&P 500 index over the following 30 days, computed from options‑based theory and current options‑market data.  
VIX is a volatility index derived from S&P 500 options for the 30 days following the measurement date, with each option price representing the market’s expectation of 30‑day forward‑looking volatility.  
The VIX index calculation employs rules for selecting component options and a formula to calculate index values.  
VIX cannot be bought or sold directly.  
VIX is traded via derivative contracts, exchange‑traded funds (ETFs), and exchange‑traded notes (ETNs) that most commonly track VIX futures indexes.  
CBOE uses the same methodology to compute volatility indexes for other benchmarks such as the Nasdaq‑100 (VXNSM), DJIA (VXDSM), and Russell 2000 (RVXSM).  
There is a VIX of VIX (VVIX) which measures the expected volatility of the 30‑day forward price of the VIX.
