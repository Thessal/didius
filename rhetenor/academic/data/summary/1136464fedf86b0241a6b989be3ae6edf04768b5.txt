Michael Harris argues that the VIX merely tracks the inverse of price and has no predictive power.  
Some argue that the VIX should have predictive power when the prices computed by the Black–Scholes equation are valid assumptions about future volatility.  
Robert J. Shiller contends that using the VIX as proof of Black–Scholes is circular reasoning because both express the same implied volatility.  
Robert J. Shiller found that calculating the VIX retrospectively for 1929 did not predict the heightened volatility of the Great Depression, suggesting the VIX lacks predictive power.
