"Standard deviation measures how far typical values are from the mean, but other measures exist.",20,5,5,1,1,3,5,4
"Mean absolute deviation may be a more direct measure of average distance than root‑mean‑square deviation.",31,4,5,1,1,2,5,4
"Understanding standard deviation helps appreciate variation from the average.",25,4,5,1,1,2,5,4
"Standard deviation is often used to compare real‑world data against a model.",16,5,5,1,1,2,5,4
"In industrial applications product weights may need to comply with a legally required value.",23,4,5,1,5,2,5,4
"Weighing a sample gives an average weight that will always differ slightly from the long‑term average.",23,5,5,2,1,2,5,4
"Using standard deviations allows calculation of a range that contains the average weight with very high probability (≥99.9%).",29,5,5,2,1,2,5,4
