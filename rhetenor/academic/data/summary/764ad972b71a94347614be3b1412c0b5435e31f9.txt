A study has shown that socio‑economic development follows a law that produces recurrent sequences of waves or impulses.  
The stock exchange provides reliable data for demonstrating wave‑impulse phenomena in human activity.  
Forecasting has been attempted with greater intensity in the stock market than in any other field, yet with little success.  
Economists, statisticians, technicians, policymakers, and bankers have all attempted to predict New York Stock Exchange prices.  
A distinct field of activity has emerged that is aimed at predicting the market.  
The 1929 reversal from the largest bull market to the largest bear market surprised almost all investors.  
Leading investment firms that spend hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on market research suffered millions of dollars in losses because they held stocks too long after price drops.  
Successful market forecasts can generate large profits.  
Even occasional success in a single market forecast can yield substantial wealth.  
From July 1932 to March 1937, the average rise of thirty leading stocks was 337%.  
During that five‑year period, some individual stocks achieved percentage gains much higher than the average.  
The overall growth during that period occurred as a series of up‑and‑down steps lasting several months, not as a straight line.  
Smaller up‑and‑down moves present an even greater profit opportunity.  
Prediction successes have been accidental because market participants failed to recognize the market’s psychological nature.  
Price movements follow underlying patterns of rhythms or ordered sequences rather than being purely random.  
Experienced observers consider market predictions to lack validity beyond random chance.
