A study of human activity has shown that socio‑economic development follows a law that produces recurrent sequences of waves or impulses.  
These waves or impulses have a stable relationship with each other over time.  
The stock exchange provides reliable data for studying such wave impulses in socio‑economic activity.  
Forecasting has been attempted with great intensity in the stock market but has yielded little result compared to other fields.  
Economists, statisticians, technicians, regulators and bankers have all attempted to predict New York Stock Exchange prices.  
The 1929 market reversal from a major bull market to a major bear market surprised almost all investors.  
Leading investment firms that spend hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on market research suffered millions of dollars in losses due to holding stock price drops too long.  
Successful market forecasts can generate large profits, and even occasional successes can yield substantial wealth.  
From July 1932 to March 1937, the average rise of thirty leading stocks was 337%.  
During that five‑year period, some individual stocks achieved percentage gains much higher than the average.  
The overall growth from 1932 to 1937 was not a straight line but a series of up‑and‑down steps lasting several months.  
Smaller up‑and‑down moves present even bigger profit opportunities.  
Market prediction successes have been largely accidental because traders failed to recognize the market as a psychological phenomenon.  
Price movements are the result of underlying rhythms or an ordered sequence rather than random noise.  
Experienced observers consider market predictions to lack validity beyond random chance.
