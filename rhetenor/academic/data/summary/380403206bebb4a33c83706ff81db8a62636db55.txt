Conventional fundamental analysis techniques were found by Sherman to be inconsistent, leading him to adopt technical analysis for market insights.  
In the 1960s most stock investors purchased stocks primarily for dividend yield rather than growth prospects.  
Mutual fund trading was almost unheard of in the 1960s.  
Sherman aimed to maximize dividend yield by buying stocks at price bottoms that occurred two or three times a year, though the timing lacked a consistent rhythm.  
Sherman and Marian observed that sharp market declines caused both the 10% and 5% exponential moving averages (EMAs) of daily breadth numbers to move to deeply negative levels.  
During most uptrends, the 10% and 5% EMAs of daily breadth remain positive.  
Waiting for daily breadth EMAs to transition from deeply negative to positive caused traders to miss the early portion of upward moves.  
A crossover where the 10% EMA moves above the 5% EMA, even while both are negative, provides an advance warning of a market reversal.  
The McClellans calculated the difference between the 10% and 5% EMAs of daily breadth to monitor such crossovers.  
Large differences between the 10% and 5% EMAs indicate extremely overbought or oversold market conditions.  
The resulting indicator, known as the McClellan Oscillator, functions as an oscillator that oscillates between extreme values and is neutral at zero.  
Marian performed EMA calculations manually on paper before the invention of hand‑held calculators.  
Gene Morgan invited developers of market analysis tools to contact him; Sherman responded, and Morgan named the tool the "McClellan Oscillator," which became a daily feature on his TV show.
