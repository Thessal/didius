Conventional fundamental analysis techniques did not work consistently for Sherman, leading him to adopt technical analysis.  
In the 1960s most stock investors bought stocks primarily for dividend yield rather than growth prospects.  
Trading in mutual funds was almost unheard of in the 1960s.  
The goal of stock purchases at that time was to maximize dividend yield.  
Sherman observed that price bottoms occurred about two or three times a year, but their timing varied without a clear rhythm.  
When the stock market declined sharply, both the 10 % and 5 % exponential moving averages (EMAs) of daily breadth numbers moved to deeply negative levels.  
During most uptrends, the 10 % and 5 % EMAs of daily breadth numbers show positive values.  
Waiting for the daily breadth EMA to move from deeply negative to positive caused traders to miss the early part of an up move.  
A crossover where the 10 % EMA moves above the 5 % EMA, even while both are negative, provides an advance warning of a market reversal.  
The McClellans calculated the difference between the 10 % and 5 % daily breadth EMAs to monitor such crossovers.  
A large difference between the 10 % and 5 % breadth EMAs indicates extremely overbought or oversold market conditions.  
The resulting indicator, later named the McClellan Oscillator, functions as an oscillator that oscillates between extreme values and is neutral at zero.  
Before calculators, Marian performed EMA calculations manually on paper.  
Gene Morgan invited developers of market analysis tools, and Sherman responded; Morgan coined the name “McClellan Oscillator” and featured it daily on his TV show.
