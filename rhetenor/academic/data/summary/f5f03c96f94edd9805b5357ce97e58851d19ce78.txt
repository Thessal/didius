VIX is the ticker symbol and popular name for the CBOE Volatility Index, a popular measure of the stock market’s expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options.  
VIX is calculated and disseminated on a real‑time basis by the CBOE and is often referred to as the “fear index” or “fear gauge”.  
The VIX traces its origin to the financial economics research of Menachem Brenner and Dan Galai.  
Brenner and Galai proposed a volatility index, to be named “Sigma Index”, that would be updated frequently and used as the underlying asset for futures and options.  
In 1992, the CBOE hired consultant Bob Whaley to calculate values for stock market volatility based on this theoretical work.  
The resulting VIX index formulation provides a measure of market volatility on which expectations of further stock market volatility in the near future might be based.
