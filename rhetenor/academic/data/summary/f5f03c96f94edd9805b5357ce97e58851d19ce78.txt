VIX is the ticker symbol and popular name for the CBOE Volatility Index, a popular measure of the stock market’s expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options.  
VIX is calculated and disseminated on a real‑time basis by the CBOE.  
VIX is often referred to as the “fear index” or “fear gauge.”  
The VIX traces its origin to the financial‑economics research of Menachem Brenner and Dan Galai.  
In a series of papers beginning in 1989, Brenner and Galai proposed creating a series of volatility indices, starting with an index on stock‑market volatility and later extending to interest‑rate and foreign‑exchange volatility.  
Brenner and Galai proposed that the volatility index, to be named “Sigma Index,” would be updated frequently and used as the underlying asset for futures and options.  
A volatility index would play the same role as a market index does for options and futures on that index.  
In 1992, the CBOE hired consultant Bob Whaley to calculate values for stock‑market volatility based on this theoretical work.  
The VIX index formulation provides a measure of market volatility on which expectations of further stock‑market volatility in the near future might be based.
