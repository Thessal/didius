Volume–price trend (VPT) is a technical analysis indicator intended to relate price and volume in the stock market.  
VPT is based on a running cumulative volume that adds or subtracts a multiple of the percentage change in share price trend and current volume, depending upon the investment's upward or downward movements.  
VPT total, i.e., the zero point, is arbitrary; only the shape of the resulting indicator is used, not the actual level of the total.  
VPT is similar to on-balance volume (OBV), but whereas OBV takes volume only according to whether the close was higher or lower, VPT includes how much higher or lower it was.  
VPT is interpreted in similar ways to OBV; generally, the idea is that volume is higher on days with a price move in the dominant direction.  
When prices are going up, VPT should be going up too, and when prices make a new rally high, VPT should also go higher.  
If VPT fails to go past its previous rally high, this is a negative divergence, suggesting a weak move.  
Money Flow Index, on-balance volume, and accumulation/distribution index are other price‑volume indicators.
