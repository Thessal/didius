Volume–price trend (VPT) is a technical analysis indicator intended to relate price and volume in the stock market.  
VPT is based on a running cumulative volume that adds or subtracts a multiple of the percentage change in share price and current volume, depending on upward or downward movements.  
VPT total, i.e., the zero point, is arbitrary; only the shape of the indicator is used, not the actual level of the total.  
VPT is similar to on-balance volume (OBV), but VPT includes the magnitude of the price change, whereas OBV only considers whether the close was higher or lower.  
VPT is interpreted similarly to OBV: volume is higher on days with a price move in the dominant direction.  
When prices are going up, VPT should be going up too, and when prices make a new rally high, VPT should also make a new rally high.  
If VPT fails to exceed its previous rally high, this negative divergence suggests a weak move.  
The VPT formula is: VPT = VPT_prev + volume × (close_today – close_prev) / close_prev.
