f equals 1 minus 2 divided by (N plus 1), which simplifies to (N‑1)/(N+1).  
Triple EMA at time 0 equals (1‑f) cubed times the series (p₀ + 3 f p₁ + 6 f² p₂ + 10 f³ p₃ + …).  
The coefficients in the Triple EMA series are the triangular numbers given by n(n+1)/2.  
Because f is less than 1, the powers fⁿ decrease faster than the triangular coefficients increase.  
Consequently, beyond a certain term the magnitude of the remaining Triple EMA terms becomes negligible.
