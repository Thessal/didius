f equals 1 minus 2 divided by (N plus 1), which simplifies to (N − 1) / (N + 1).  
The triple exponential moving average at time 0 is (1 − f)³ times the series (p₀ + 3f p₁ + 6f² p₂ + 10f³ p₃ + …).  
The coefficients in the triple EMA expansion are the triangular numbers given by n(n + 1)/2.  
Because f is less than 1, the powers fⁿ decrease faster than the triangular coefficients increase.  
Beyond a certain term, the magnitude of all remaining terms in the triple EMA series becomes negligible.
