Standard deviation is often used as a measure of the risk associated with price fluctuations of stocks.  
Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns for stocks.  
Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent and a standard deviation of 20 percentage points.  
Stock B over the same period had an average return of 12 percent and a standard deviation of 30 percentage points.  
On the basis of risk and return, an investor may consider Stock A the safer choice because Stock B’s additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 percentage points of standard deviation.  
Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment more often than Stock A under the same circumstances.  
Risk is an important factor in efficiently managing a portfolio of stock investments because it determines the variation in returns and provides a mathematical basis for investment decisions.  
As risk increases, the expected return on a stock investment should increase, known as the risk premium.  
Investors should expect a higher return on a stock investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty.
