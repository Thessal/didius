In finance, standard deviation is often used as a measure of the risk associated with price fluctuations of a given asset such as stocks.  
The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, known as the risk premium.  
Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.  
Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent with a standard deviation of 20 percentage points, while Stock B had an average return of 12 percent with a standard deviation of 30 percentage points.  
An investor may consider Stock A the safer choice because Stock B’s additional 2 percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 percentage points of standard deviation.  
Risk is an important factor in efficiently managing a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset or portfolio and provides a mathematical basis for investment decisions such as mean‑variance optimization.
