The relative strength index (RSI) is a technical indicator used in the analysis of financial markets.  
The RSI is intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a recent trading period.  
The RSI is classified as a momentum oscillator, measuring the velocity and magnitude of price movements.  
Momentum is the rate of the rise or fall in price.  
The relative strength (RS) is given as the ratio of higher closes to lower closes.  
The RSI computes momentum as the ratio of higher closes to overall closes, so stocks with more or stronger positive changes have a higher RSI than stocks with more or stronger negative changes.  
The RSI is most typically used on a 14‑day timeframe, measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with high and low levels marked at 70 and 30, respectively.  
Shorter or longer timeframes are used for alternately shorter or longer outlooks.  
Higher and lower levels such as 80/20 or 90/10 occur less frequently but indicate stronger momentum.  
The relative strength index was developed by J. Welles Wilder and published in a 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, and in Commodities magazine in June 1978.  
The RSI has become one of the most popular oscillator indices.  
The RSI provides signals that tell investors to buy when the security or currency is oversold and to sell when it is overbought.  
RSI with recommended parameters and its day‑to‑day optimization was tested and compared with other strategies in Marek and Šedivá (2017).  
The testing, which was randomised across time and companies such as Apple, Exxon Mobil, IBM, and Microsoft, showed that RSI can still produce good results; however, over longer periods it is usually outperformed by the simple buy‑and‑hold strategy.  
For each trading period an upward change U or downward change D is calculated: for up periods U = close_now − close_previous and D = 0; for down periods U = 0 and D = close_previous − close_now.
