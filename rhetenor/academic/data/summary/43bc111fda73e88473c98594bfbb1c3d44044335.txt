A positive divergence or bullish divergence occurs when the price makes a new low but the MACD does not confirm with a new low of its own.  
A negative divergence or bearish divergence occurs when the price makes a new high but the MACD does not confirm with a new high of its own.  
A divergence with respect to price may occur on the MACD line and/or the MACD histogram.  
The MACD is only as useful as the context in which it is applied.  
An analyst might apply the MACD to a weekly scale before looking at a daily scale to avoid making short‑term trades against the direction of the intermediate trend.  
Analysts will vary the parameters of the MACD to track trends of varying duration.  
One popular short‑term MACD set‑up is the (5,35,5) parameter configuration.  
The MACD can generate false signals.  
A false positive is a bullish crossover followed by a sudden decline in a stock.  
A false negative is a bearish crossover followed by a sudden upward acceleration in the stock.  
Applying a filter that requires the MACD line to stay above the signal line for three days reduces false signals but increases missed profit opportunities.  
Analysts use various approaches to filter out false signals and confirm true ones.  
A MACD crossover of the signal line indicates that the direction of acceleration is changing.  
The MACD line crossing zero suggests that the average velocity is changing direction.
