"Population variance calculated as 4 from the eight values.",21,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Population standard deviation equals 2.",7,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Formula is valid only when the eight values constitute the entire population.",17,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
"If the values are a random sample, divide by n‑1 giving s ≈ 2.1.",60,5,5,5,2,3,5,5
"The original formula result is called the sample standard deviation and denoted by s.",22,5,5,5,1,3,5,5
"Dividing by n‑1 provides an unbiased variance estimate (Bessel's correction).",25,5,5,5,2,3,5,5
"The sample variance formula underestimates variability if divided by n because the sample mean is close to observations.",48,4,5,4,1,3,5,5
"When the population is approximately normal, standard deviation indicates proportion of observations above or below values.",24,4,5,4,1,3,5,5
"Average adult male height in the US is about 69 inches with a standard deviation of ~3 inches.",22,4,4,3,1,2,5,5
"About 68% of men are within 3 inches of the mean height (66–72 inches).",22,4,4,3,1,2,5,5
