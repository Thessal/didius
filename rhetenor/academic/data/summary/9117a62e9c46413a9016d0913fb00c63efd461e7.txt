"The number of issues traded increased in 1955 and trended down until at least 1968, while the DJIA moved higher.",20,5,2,5,1,4,5,2
"Norman G. Fosback attributed the long‑term increase in issues traded to a downward bias in the cumulative advance‑decline line.",19,5,3,4,1,3,5,3
"Fosback was the next influential technician in the development of the Negative Volume Index and Positive Volume Index.",18,5,2,5,1,3,5,2
"In 1976 Fosback reported his findings on NVI and PVI in his book Stock Market Logic.",16,5,2,5,1,4,5,2
"Fosback noted that historically Negative Volume Indexes have always been constructed using advance‑decline data.",14,5,2,5,1,4,5,2
"Fosback argued there is no good reason to fixate on the advance‑decline line because a Negative Volume Index can be calculated from any market index.",25,4,3,4,1,4,5,3
"Dysart wrote that using issues‑traded data is more all‑encompassing and better represents the whole market than price data.",18,4,3,4,1,5,5,3
"Fosback cumulated daily percent changes in the market index instead of advance‑decline differences for NVI and PVI calculations.",18,5,2,5,1,4,5,2
"On negative volume days, Fosback added the index’s percent price change to the previous NVI value; on positive volume days, he added it to the previous PVI value.",28,5,2,5,1,4,5,2
"Fosback suggested starting the cumulative NVI/PVI count at a base index level such as 100.",15,5,2,5,1,4,5,2
"Fosback derived buy or sell signals based on whether NVI or PVI was above or below its one‑year moving average.",20,5,2,5,1,4,5,2
"When NVI is above its one‑year moving average, there is a 96% probability of a bull market; when below, there is a 53% probability of a bear market.",28,4,3,4,1,3,5,3
"These probability results were derived from a test period covering 1941–1975.",11,5,2,5,1,4,5,2
"Modern tests might reveal different probabilities for NVI and PVI signals.",11,2,3,3,1,2,5,3
"Today NVI and PVI are commonly associated with Fosback's versions, and Dysart, their inventor, is largely forgotten.",17,4,3,4,1,3,5,3
"It cannot be said that one version of NVI/PVI is better than the other.",14,3,2,3,1,2,5,3
"Fosback provided a more objective interpretation of these indicators, while Dysart's versions offer valuable market insight.",16,4,3,4,1,3,5,3
