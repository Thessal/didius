The advance–decline line is a stock market technical indicator used by investors to measure the number of individual stocks participating in a market rise or fall.  
Price changes of large stocks can have a disproportionate effect on capitalization‑weighted indices such as the S&P 500, NYSE Composite, and NASDAQ Composite, making it useful to know how broadly the movement extends into smaller stocks.  
Market indexes represent a group of stocks and therefore do not present the whole picture of the trading day’s market performance.  
Advance/decline numbers provide information about the individual performance of particular stocks, complementing market indices.  
The advance–decline line plots the cumulative sum of the daily difference between the number of advancing issues (above the previous day’s close) and the number of declining issues in a given stock market index.  
The advance–decline line moves up when an index has more advancing than declining issues and moves down when there are more declining than advancing issues.  
The advance–decline line value is calculated as today’s advancing stocks minus today’s declining stocks plus yesterday’s AD line value.  
The advance/decline line formula can also be applied to the volume of advancing and declining stocks, using advanced volume minus declined volume plus yesterday’s AD volume line value.
