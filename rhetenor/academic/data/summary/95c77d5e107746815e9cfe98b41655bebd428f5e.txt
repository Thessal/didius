The advance–decline line is a stock market technical indicator used by investors to measure the number of individual stocks participating in a market rise or fall.  
Price changes of large stocks can have a disproportionate effect on capitalization‑weighted stock market indices such as the S&P 500, NYSE Composite Index, and NASDAQ Composite index.  
It can be useful to know how broadly market movement extends into the larger universe of smaller stocks.  
Market indexes represent a group of stocks and do not present the whole picture of the trading day and market performance.  
Advance/decline numbers give an idea about the individual performance of particular stocks, complementing market indices.  
The advance–decline line plots the cumulative sum of the daily difference between the number of advancing issues (above the previous day’s closing price) and the number of declining issues in a particular stock market index.  
The advance–decline line moves up when the index contains more advancing than declining issues and moves down when there are more declining than advancing issues.  
The advance–decline line value is calculated as today’s advancing stocks minus today’s declining stocks plus yesterday’s AD line value.  
The advance/decline line formula can be applied to the volume of advancing and declining stocks.  
The advance/decline volume line is calculated as advanced volume minus declined volume plus yesterday’s AD line value.
