"The first resistance on the up-side of the market is given by the lower width of prior trading added to the pivot point price and the first support on the down-side is the width of the upper part of the prior trading range below the pivot point.",47,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"R1 = P + (P − L) = 2×P − L",11,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"S1 = P − (H − P) = 2×P − H",11,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"These levels may simply be calculated by subtracting the previous low (L) and high (H) price, respectively, from twice the pivot point value.",23,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"The second set of resistance (R2) and support (S2) levels are above and below, respectively, the first set.",18,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"They are simply determined from the full width of the prior trading range (H − L), added to and subtracted from the pivot point, respectively.",25,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"R2 = P + (H − L)",7,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"S2 = P − (H − L)",7,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Commonly a third set is also calculated, again representing another higher resistance level (R3) and a yet lower support level (S3).",21,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"The method of the second set is continued by doubling the range added and subtracted from the pivot point.",19,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"R3 = H + 2×(P − L) = R1 + (H − L)",13,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"S3 = L − 2×(H − P) = S1 − (H − L)",13,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"This concept is sometimes, albeit rarely, extended to a fourth set in which the tripled value of the trading range is used in the calculation.",25,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"Qualitatively, the second and higher support and resistance levels are always located symmetrically around the pivot point, whereas this is not the case for the first levels, unless the pivot point happens to divide the prior trading range exactly in half.",41,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"The pivot point itself represents a level of highest resistance or support, depending on the overall market condition.",18,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"If the market is directionless (undecided), prices may fluctuate greatly around this level until a price breakout develops.",18,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"Trading above or below the pivot point indicates the overall market sentiment.",12,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"It is a leading indicator providing advanced signaling of potentially new market highs or lows within a given time frame.",20,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"The support and resistance levels calculated from the pivot point and the previous market width may be used as exit points of trades, but are rarely used as entry signals.",30,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"If the market is up-trending and breaks through the pivot point, the first resistance level is often a good target to close a position, as the probability of resistance and reversal increases greatly.",33,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"Many traders recognize the half-way levels between any of these levels as additional, but weaker resistance or support areas.",19,4,5,4,1,1,5,5
"The middle or mid-point pivots between the pivot points have no standard label format unlike the support and resistance labels.",20,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"It's common that the label start with the letter (M), and then a symbol or number after it.",18,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Using (+) and (-) symbols, the mid-point between the pivot point and R1 can be designated as M+, between R1 and R2 is M++.",24,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Below the pivot point the mid-points are labeled as M− and M−−.",12,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
"Using a number format starting from 0 to 5, the mid-points start as M0 between S3 and S2 up to M5 between R2 and R3.",25,5,5,5,1,1,5,5
