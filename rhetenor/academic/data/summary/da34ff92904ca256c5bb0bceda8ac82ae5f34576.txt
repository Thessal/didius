The Relative Strength Index (RSI) adds a new dimension to chart interpretation when plotted with a daily bar chart.  
Tops and bottoms are indicated when the RSI goes above 70 or drops below 30.  
Chart formations that appear on the RSI may not be apparent on the bar chart.  
Failure swings above 70 or below 30 on the RSI scale are strong indications of market reversals.  
Support and resistance often appear clearly on the RSI before becoming apparent on the bar chart.  
Divergence between the RSI and price action is a very strong indication that a market turning point is imminent.  
The momentum oscillator measures the velocity of directional price movement.  
When price moves up very rapidly, it is considered overbought; when it moves down very rapidly, it is considered oversold.  
Overbought or oversold conditions imply that a reaction or reversal is imminent.  
The slope of the momentum oscillator is directly proportional to the velocity of the move.  
The distance traveled by the momentum oscillator is proportional to the magnitude of the move.  
The momentum oscillator is typically displayed as a line on a chart with magnitude on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.  
The momentum oscillator moves very rapidly at market turning points and tends to slow down as the market continues in a directional move.  
An oscillator calculated as today’s price minus the price ten days ago is measured from a zero line, yielding a positive value when today’s price is higher and a negative value when it is lower.
