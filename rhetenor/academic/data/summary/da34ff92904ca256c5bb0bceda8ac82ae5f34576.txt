The Relative Strength Index (RSI) adds a new dimension to chart interpretation when plotted alongside a daily bar chart.  
Tops and bottoms are indicated when the RSI rises above 70 or falls below 30.  
Chart formations that appear on the RSI may not be apparent on the bar chart.  
Failure swings above 70 or below 30 on the RSI are strong indications of market reversals.  
Support and resistance levels often become visible on the RSI before they appear on the bar chart.  
Divergence between the RSI and price action is a very strong indication that a market turning point is imminent.  
The momentum oscillator measures the velocity of directional price movement.  
When price moves up very rapidly, the momentum oscillator indicates an overbought condition; when price moves down very rapidly, it indicates an oversold condition.  
An overbought or oversold condition suggests that a reaction or reversal is imminent.  
The slope of the momentum oscillator is directly proportional to the velocity of the price move.  
The distance traveled by the momentum oscillator is proportional to the magnitude of the price move.  
The momentum oscillator is typically displayed as a line chart with magnitude on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.  
The momentum oscillator moves rapidly at market turning points and tends to slow down as the market continues in a directional move.  
A simple oscillator can be expressed as today’s price minus the price X days ago (e.g., ten days ago).  
The oscillator value is positive when today’s price is higher than the price X days ago and negative when it is lower.
