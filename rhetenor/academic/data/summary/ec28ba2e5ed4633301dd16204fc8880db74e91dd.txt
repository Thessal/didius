"A sustained period, not just one or two days of small changes, is required.",17,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"A congestion zone is the Oscillator area where congestion occurs, typically forming above the zero line.",21,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Congestion zones rarely form at extended negative values.",9,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"A congestion zone should be exited, as a basic rule.",16,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"The chart shows several examples of congestion zones.",10,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Congestion zones display several days of Oscillator values in a narrow range, and when it breaks out, the market sharply declines.",37,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Some congestion zones form at or below zero, yet still result in a drop out of the zone.",28,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"A single day's Oscillator value is insufficient; a chart and interpretation are needed to detect congestion zones and divergences.",30,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Oscillator fluctuations on one side of zero over days constitute a 'complex structure'.",25,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"A complex structure indicates strength on its side of zero, positive or negative.",19,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"A simple structure occurs when the Oscillator crosses zero and reverses direction within a few days, without forming a complex structure.",42,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Simple structures suggest weakness on their side, even if not evident during their formation.",28,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"If the Oscillator chops below zero, it shows strong bears, then a brief pop above zero indicates bulls attempting to regain control.",33,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"When the Oscillator spikes up through zero then quickly reverses, it signals weak bulls who relinquish control to bears.",53,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"The chart displays examples of both complex and simple structures.",12,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"A complex structure predicts additional strength for its side of the market; above zero is bullish, below zero bearish.",40,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Strength from a complex structure can be briefly halted by the opposite side, yet overall more strength is expected.",33,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"Trending price moves often consist of successive complex structures briefly interrupted by simple structures.",27,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
"If complex structures transition to a simple one, it may indicate the market's trending side is about to relinquish control temporarily.",32,5,5,5,1,5,5,5
