The Donchian channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by Richard Donchian.  
It is formed by taking the highest high and the lowest low of the last n periods.  
The area between the high and the low is the channel for the period chosen.  
Donchian Channels are a technical indicator that seeks to identify bullish and bearish extremes that favor reversals, breakouts, breakdowns, and emerging trends.  
The upper channel equals the highest high over N periods, the lower channel equals the lowest low over N periods, and the middle line equals (Upper + Lower) ÷ 2, where N is usually 20.  
The Donchian channel is commonly available on most trading platforms.  
The Donchian channel is a useful indicator for seeing the volatility of a market price.  
If a price is stable, the Donchian channel will be relatively narrow; if the price fluctuates a lot, the Donchian channel will be wider.  
Its primary use is for providing signals for long and short positions.  
If a security trades above its highest n periods high, a long position is established.  
If a security trades below its lowest n periods low, a short position is established.  
Originally the n periods were based on daily values, but today the period can be set to any desired interval such as day, hour, minute, or ticks.  
Extensive backtesting using 360 years of exchange data and 4,887 test trades with the default setting of 20 indicates that the Donchian channel indicator was ineffective.  
The indicator yielded a win rate of 35 percent of trades.  
Combined with a reward‑to‑risk ratio of 2.0 to 1, it yields an expected profit of 5 cents per dollar invested.  
When combined with slippage, the Donchian channel indicator might be unprofitable.
