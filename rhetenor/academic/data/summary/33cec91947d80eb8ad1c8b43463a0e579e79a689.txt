The Donchian channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by Richard Donchian.  
It is formed by taking the highest high and the lowest low of the last n periods, and the area between them is the channel.  
Donchian Channels are a technical indicator that seeks to identify bullish and bearish extremes that favor reversals, breakouts, breakdowns, and emerging trends.  
The upper channel equals the highest high over N periods.  
The lower channel equals the lowest low over N periods.  
The middle line equals (Upper + Lower) ÷ 2.  
N is usually equal to 20.  
The Donchian channel is commonly available on most trading platforms.  
The Donchian channel width reflects market price volatility; a narrow channel indicates a stable price and a wide channel indicates a fluctuating price.  
The primary use of the Donchian channel is to provide signals for long and short positions.  
If a security trades above its highest n‑period high, a long position is established.  
If a security trades below its lowest n‑period low, a short position is established.  
Originally the n periods were based on daily values, but modern platforms allow any period such as day, hour, minute, or ticks.  
Extensive backtesting using 360 years of exchange data and 4,887 test trades with the default setting of 20 indicated that the Donchian channel indicator was ineffective.  
The indicator yielded a win rate of 35 % of trades.  
Combined with a reward‑to‑risk ratio of 2.0 : 1, it yields an expected profit of 5 cents per dollar invested.  
When combined with slippage, the indicator might be unprofitable.
