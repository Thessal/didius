The Vortex Indicator is simple to use as the only required inputs are the high, low and close of a price bar.  
Traders may use the Vortex Indicator on its own, in combination with other technical indicators to confirm a change of trend or as part of a larger trading system.  
The Vortex Indicator may be used for any market such as stocks, futures or currencies.  
The Vortex Indicator may be used for any time frame such as 15‑minute, hourly or weekly charts.  
The Vortex Indicator may be used for any parameter such as 13, 21 or 34 periods.  
The inventors of the Vortex Indicator recommend using longer time frames and parameters in order to filter out false signals.  
If a trader uses a very short time frame such as 5 minutes, it should be combined with a long parameter of 34 or 55 periods.  
Because of its universal applicability, the Vortex Indicator is suitable for both short‑term traders and longer‑term fund managers who wish to identify larger macro trends within a market.  
The Vortex Indicator is available on most charting software.  
Some charting software companies have suggested additional trading strategies to use with the Vortex Indicator, including the implementation of a trailing stop and the use of supporting indicators to reduce false signals.  
In a comparative study testing the Vortex Indicator against Welles Wilder’s Directional Movement Indicator (DMI) using a portfolio of 38 actively traded futures contracts from 3 January 1978 to 6 November 2009 with a 14‑day parameter, the Vortex Indicator showed better performance than the DMI over the entire test period and during the last 10 years.  
In a similar test based on 101 NASDAQ stocks from 2 January 1992 to 14 August 2009, the DMI showed better performance than the Vortex Indicator.
