The Vortex Indicator requires only the high, low, and close of a price bar as inputs.  
Traders may use the Vortex Indicator on its own, in combination with other technical indicators, or as part of a larger trading system.  
The Vortex Indicator can be applied to any market, including stocks, futures, and currencies.  
The Vortex Indicator can be used on any time frame, such as 15‑minute, hourly, or weekly charts.  
The Vortex Indicator can be calculated with any parameter length, for example 13, 21, or 34 periods.  
The inventors of the Vortex Indicator recommend using longer time frames and longer parameters to filter out false signals.  
If a trader uses a very short time frame, such as 5 minutes, it should be combined with a long parameter of 34 or 55 periods.  
The Vortex Indicator is suitable for both short‑term traders and longer‑term fund managers seeking to identify macro trends.  
The Vortex Indicator is available on most charting software platforms.  
Some charting software providers suggest using the Vortex Indicator together with trailing stops and supporting indicators to reduce false signals.
