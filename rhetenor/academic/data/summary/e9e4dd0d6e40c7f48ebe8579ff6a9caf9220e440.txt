K can be calculated once for each commodity and reused daily, only being recalculated when the margin requirement or commission rate changes.  
For Soybeans, K equals 0.4641 and the CSI is calculated as ADXR × ATR14 × K, giving a CSI of 348.  
For Bellies, K equals 4.464 and the CSI is calculated as ADXR × ATR44 × K, giving a CSI of 280.  
The Directional Movement Index worksheet calculates CSI daily by multiplying ADXR, ATR44, and the constant K.  
ADXR is defined as the average of the latest ADX value and the ADX value from 14 days ago.  
ATR44 is calculated by dividing the ATR value by 14.  
In the example, Coffee with ADXR 70, ATR14 3.75 c, margin $9,000, and commission $85 yields a CSI of 318.  
Soybeans in the same example have a CSI of 348, making Soybeans the better overall deal than Coffee.  
The average daily dollar movement for Soybeans is $750, calculated as ATR 15 c × $50.  
Assuming capture of 70% of the move for Coffee and 50% for Soybeans over ten days, profit after commission is $9,758.75 for Coffee and $3,705.00 for Soybeans.  
Because Soybeans require less margin, three Soybean contracts can be traded for each Coffee contract, resulting in a total Soybean profit of $11,115 versus $9,758.75 for Coffee.
