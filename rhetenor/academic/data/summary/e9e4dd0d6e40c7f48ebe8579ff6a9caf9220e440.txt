CSI is calculated as ADXR multiplied by ATR14 multiplied by a constant K for each commodity.  
K is a constant that depends on the margin requirement and commission rate and only needs to be recalculated when those change.  
For Soybeans, K equals 0.4641 and the resulting CSI equals 348 using ADXR 50 and ATR14 15.  
For Bellies, K equals 4.464 and the resulting CSI equals 280 using ADXR 37 and ATR44 1.70.  
ADXR is defined as the average of the latest ADX and the ADX from 14 days ago.  
ATR44 is defined as the value in the ATR column divided by 14.  
In an example, Coffee with ADXR 70, ATR14 3.75, margin $9,000 and commission $85 yields a CSI of 318.  
Soybeans have a CSI of 348 in the same comparison, making Soybeans the better overall deal than Coffee.  
The average dollar movement per day for Soybeans is $750 (ATR 15 cents × $50 per cent).  
The average dollar movement per day for Coffee is $1,406.25 (ATR 3.75 cents × $375 per cent).  
Assuming a 10‑day trade and capturing 70% of Coffee’s move and 50% of Soybeans’ move, profit after commission is $9,758.75 for Coffee and $3,705.00 for Soybeans per contract.  
Because Soybeans require less margin, three Soybean contracts can be traded for each Coffee contract, yielding a total profit of $11,115 for Soybeans versus $9,758.75 for Coffee.
