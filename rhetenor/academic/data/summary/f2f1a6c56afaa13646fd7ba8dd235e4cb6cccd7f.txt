Because on-balance volume (OBV) is cumulative, its value depends on the starting point of the calculation.  
Each day's total volume is assigned a positive sign if the closing price is higher than the previous day and a negative sign if the closing price is lower.  
When prices rise, OBV should rise as well, and when prices reach a new rally high, OBV should also reach a new high.  
If OBV fails to exceed its previous rally high, this negative divergence suggests a weak move.  
The technique was originally called “continuous volume” by Woods and Vignola and later named “on-balance volume” by Joseph Granville, who popularized it in his 1963 book.  
The OBV index can be applied to individual stocks based on their daily up or down closes, or to the overall market using breadth data such as the advance/decline ratio.  
OBV is generally used to confirm price movements.  
The premise is that volume is higher on days when the price moves in the dominant direction; for example, in a strong uptrend there is more volume on up days than on down days.  
Other price‑volume indicators include money flow, price and volume trend, and the accumulation/distribution index.  
Dimensional analysis explains why volume and price are multiplied rather than divided in such indicators.
