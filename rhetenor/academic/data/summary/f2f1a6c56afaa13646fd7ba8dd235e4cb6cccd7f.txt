Because OBV is cumulative, its value depends on the starting point of the calculation.  
Total daily volume is assigned a positive value when the closing price is higher than the previous close and a negative value when the closing price is lower.  
When prices rise, OBV should rise as well; when prices reach a new rally high, OBV should also reach a new high.  
If OBV fails to exceed its previous rally high, this negative divergence suggests a weak move.  
The technique was originally called “continuous volume” by Woods and Vignola and later named “on‑balance volume” by Joseph Granville in his 1963 book Granville’s New Key to Stock Market Profits.  
The OBV index can be applied to individual stocks based on their daily up or down close, or to the market as a whole using market breadth data such as the advance/decline ratio.  
OBV is generally used to confirm price moves.  
The idea behind OBV is that volume is higher on days when the price move is in the dominant direction; for example, in a strong uptrend there is more volume on up days than on down days.  
Money flow, price and volume trend, and accumulation/distribution index are other price‑volume indicators.
