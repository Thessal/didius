"Moving average is susceptible to rare events such as rapid shocks or anomalies.",26,5,5,5,1,2,5,4
"Simple moving median over n time points provides a more robust trend estimate.",16,5,5,5,1,2,5,4
"Median is obtained by sorting values in the window and selecting the middle value.",20,5,5,5,1,5,5,4
"For larger n, median can be efficiently computed using an indexable skiplist.",16,5,5,5,1,5,5,4
"Moving average is optimal for trend recovery when fluctuations are normally distributed.",24,5,5,5,1,2,5,4
