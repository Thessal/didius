"Sometimes these threes are heterogeneous in direction: ascending and lateral or descending and lateral (Figures 27-30).",16,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Triangles are made up of five waves (or five legs).",10,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"In large patterns each segment consists of three waves (Figures 31-32).",11,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"On medium-sized specimens the fourth and fifth legs may be one wave each (Figure 33).",15,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"On small specimens the legs often consist of only one wave.",11,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"The main reference point in the formation of a triangle is the generators - straight lines drawn through its vertices.",20,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"You cannot be sure a triangle is forming until the fifth wave begins.",13,2,3,3,1,5,5,5
"Figure 34 shows three existing types of triangles.",8,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"The fifth segment can end within or outside the triangle generators (Figures 35-36).",13,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Figures 10 and 13 represent the \"double zigzags\" that Elliott discusses in Chapter 6.",14,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Either Elliott got the illustrations mixed up here, or he thought double zigzags were more common at the Primary level than normal zigzags.",23,3,4,3,1,3,5,5
"For an illustration of a true Primary-level zigzag, refer to section [A-B-C] of Figure 7 and Figure 27 of *The Wave Principle*.",22,5,4,4,2,5,5,5
"In preparing Figures 27-28 Elliott omitted a statement; an additional \"three\" was unintentionally missed in each correction, so the subsequent movement cannot be a resumption of the trend that preceded the correction.",32,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"The same.",2,3,3,3,1,3,5,5
"These illustrations represent ascending, descending and symmetrical (converging) triangles.",9,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"For an unspecified reason Elliott did not include a description of the inverted symmetrical (divergent) view.",16,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"The fifth wave of the triangle may end outside the generators, but not beyond the top of the third wave.",20,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"See footnotes 1-8 to Chapter XI.",6,5,4,4,2,5,5,5
"In addition they can be found at the site of wave B.",12,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"An extension can form in any one of the three impulses (waves 1, 3 or 5), but never in more than one (Charts 39-44).",24,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Note that in each example the total number of waves is nine if the extension is counted as five waves instead of one.",23,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"In rare cases an extended move can consist of nine waves of equal size (Figures 45-46).",16,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"Extensions are formed only in the new price territory of the current cycle; they are not formed as corrections.",19,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"The extensions \"pass twice\" along the price segment: the correction traverses the same segment twice - down and up.",19,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"This feature is relevant only when the extension develops in the fifth wave.",13,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"If an extension is formed in the first wave, a double pass can be seen in the performance of waves 2-3; if in the third wave, in waves 4-5; if in the fifth wave, see Figure 48.",37,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"If the extension is formed at lower wave levels, the rollback occurs immediately.",13,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"At Intermediate or Primary (Major) levels the double pass may not start until the entire up-move is complete.",18,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
"When the move is at high speed the same price area rolls back in the opposite direction at almost the same speed.",22,5,4,4,1,5,5,5
