Ichimoku is a technical analysis method that builds on candlestick charting to improve the accuracy of forecast price moves.  
The chart plots five lines based on recent highs, lows, and closes, with two lines forming a cloud‑like image.  
The method is applied across various asset classes and has been used by traders to predict price movements and regime shifts in global markets.  
Ichimoku is a moving‑average‑based trend identification system that provides a clearer picture of potential price action because it contains more data points than standard candlestick charts.  
Ichimoku’s lines are constructed using the 50 % point of the highs and lows rather than the candle’s closing price.  
Ichimoku takes time into account as an additional element along with price action, similar to William Delbert Gann’s trading ideas.  
Tenkan‑sen is calculated as (highest high + lowest low)/2 over the last 9 periods and serves as a signal line and minor support/resistance line.  
Kijun‑sen is calculated as (highest high + lowest low)/2 over the past 26 periods and acts as a confirmation line, support/resistance line, and can be used as a trailing stop line.
