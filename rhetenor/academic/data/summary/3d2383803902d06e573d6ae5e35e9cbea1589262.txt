Support and resistance pivot points are aligned.  
Trend lines are used in many ways by traders.  
When a stock price moves between support and resistance trend lines, traders commonly buy at support and sell at resistance, and short at resistance and cover at support, believing the trend line will hold and the trend will continue.
