The True Strength Index (TSI) is a technical indicator used in the analysis of financial markets that attempts to show both trend direction and overbought/oversold conditions.  
The TSI was first published by William Blau in 1991.  
The indicator uses moving averages of the underlying momentum of a financial instrument.  
Momentum is considered a leading indicator of price movements, and a moving average characteristically lags behind price.  
The TSI combines these characteristics to create an indication of price and direction more in sync with market turns than either momentum or moving average.  
The TSI is provided as part of the standard collection of indicators offered by various trading platforms.  
The TSI is a “double smoothed” indicator, meaning that a moving average applied to the data (daily momentum) is smoothed again by a second moving average.  
The calculation for TSI uses exponential moving averages.  
The formula for TSI is TSI(m,r,s)=100 × EMA(EMA(m,r),s) / EMA(EMA(|m|,r),s).  
In the TSI formula, m equals today’s closing price minus yesterday’s closing price (momentum).  
EMA(m,n) is the exponential moving average of m over n periods, defined as EMA(m₀,n)= (2/(n+1))[m₀ − EMA(m₁,n)] + EMA(m₁,n).
