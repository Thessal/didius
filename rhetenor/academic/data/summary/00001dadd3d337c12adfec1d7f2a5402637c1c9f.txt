The VXO is a measure of implied volatility calculated using 30‑day S&P 100 index at‑the‑money options.  
Professors Brenner and Galai developed a 1989 proposal for a series of volatility indexes, published in 1993.  
In 2003 the CBOE introduced a new methodology for the VIX, changing the underlying index from the CBOE S&P 100 Index (OEX) to the CBOE S&P 500 Index (SPX); the old methodology was renamed the VXO.  
On March 26 2004 the first-ever trading in futures on the VIX Index began on the CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE).  
VIX options were launched in February 2006.  
On October 24 2008 the VIX reached an intraday high of 89.53.  
On November 21 2008 the VIX closed at a record 80.74.  
On February 5 2018 the VIX closed at 37.32, up 103.99 % from the previous close.  
On March 9 2020 the VIX hit 62.12, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.
