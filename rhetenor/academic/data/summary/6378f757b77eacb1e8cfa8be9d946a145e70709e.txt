Ratio-Adjusted Summation Index (RASI) is calculated as a running total of all previous Ratio-Adjusted Oscillator values, using zero as the neutral value.  
RASI provides intermediate-term (several months) overbought and oversold values.  
When RASI moves from an oversold reading to above +500, it signals higher highs and strength in major averages.  
If RASI fails to get above +500, it signals further weakness on the ensuing downtrend.  
The A‑D line has been studied since at least the 1960s, with early citations by Granville (1963), Russell (2004), and Harlow (1968).  
Many NYSE issues such as preferred stocks, rights, warrants, and closed‑end funds dilute the A‑D line signal because they are interest‑sensitive and drown out votes of operating companies.  
Historically, NYSE provided “common‑only” data (issues with symbols of three letters or fewer), excluding preferred stocks, warrants, rights, bond funds, closed‑end stock funds, and country funds.  
Constructing a “pure common” A‑D line by removing contributions from closed‑end funds results in a line virtually identical to the Composite and Common‑Only A‑D lines, indicating CEFs have minimal impact on overall numbers.  
Before 1997 most stocks traded in 1/8‑point increments; NYSE changed to 1/16‑point increments in 1997 and fully converted to decimal increments on Jan 29 2001 (April 9 2001 for Nasdaq).  
After decimalization, a single‑penny move suffices to be counted as advancing or declining, whereas previously an issue had to move at least 1/8 of a point.  
Some analysts claim that decimalization increased voting bias, making the A‑D line unusable because floor specialists may manipulate closing prices to create tiny gains.  
A study of NYSE closing data from Nov 1 2001 to Mar 5 2004 examined three categories: Composite (all stocks), issues changing more than 1/16 of a point, and issues changing less than 1/16 of a point.  
The 1/16‑point (6.25 cents) threshold assumes that a 7‑cent move should be rounded up to the old 1/8‑point increment (12.5 cents) and counted as advancing or declining, while moves of 6 cents or less are rounded to unchanged.
