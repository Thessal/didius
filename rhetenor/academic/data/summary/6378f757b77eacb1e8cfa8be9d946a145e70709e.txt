Ratio-Adjusted Summation Index (RASI) is calculated as a running total of all previous Ratio-Adjusted Oscillator values.  
The neutral value for the RASI is zero, unlike the artificial +1000 neutral level used for the conventional Oscillator in 1970.  
The RASI provides intermediate-term (several months) overbought and oversold signals.  
The RASI indicates when to expect further strength or weakness in the major market averages.  
When the RASI moves from an oversold reading to above +500, it predicts higher highs.  
If the RASI fails to rise above +500, it signals that further weakness should be expected in the ensuing downtrend.  
The A‑D line has been studied since at least the 1960s, demonstrating long‑standing interest in breadth statistics.  
A criticism of the A‑D line is that inclusion of preferred stocks, rights, warrants, and closed‑end funds dilutes the signal because they are interest‑sensitive and drown out votes of operating companies.  
Historically, the NYSE provided “common‑only” data that excluded preferred stocks, warrants, rights, bond funds, closed‑end stock funds, and country funds.  
Constructing a “pure common” A‑D line by removing contributions from closed‑end funds shows that CEFs have minimal impact on overall A‑D numbers.  
Before 1997 most stocks traded in 1/8‑point increments; the NYSE changed to 1/16‑point increments in 1997 and fully converted to decimal pricing on January 29 2001 (April 9 2001 for Nasdaq).  
Prior to decimalization an issue had to move at least 1/8 of a point to be counted as advancing or declining, whereas after decimalization a single penny movement suffices.  
Some analysts claim that decimalization increased voting bias in the A‑D line, alleging that floor specialists may manipulate closing prices to create tiny gains.  
A study of NYSE closing data from November 1 2001 to March 5 2004 examined composite stocks, stocks changing more than 1/16 of a point, and stocks changing less than 1/16 of a point.  
The 1/16‑point (6.25 cents) threshold assumes that a 7‑cent move should be rounded up to the old 1/8‑point increment (12.5 cents) and counted as advancing or declining, while moves of 6 cents or less are rounded to unchanged.
