The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels in securities.  
A security is considered oversold when the CCI falls below –100 and overbought when it exceeds +100.  
A buy signal may be generated when the CCI moves back above –100 from oversold levels.  
A sell signal may be generated when the CCI moves back below +100 from overbought levels.  
Divergences can be applied to the CCI to increase the robustness of its signals.  
A positive divergence below –100 strengthens a signal based on the CCI moving back above –100.  
A negative divergence above +100 strengthens a signal based on the CCI moving back below +100.  
Trend line breaks can be used to generate trading signals with the CCI.  
Trend lines can be drawn by connecting peaks and troughs of the CCI.  
From oversold levels, an advance above –100 combined with a trend line breakout may be considered bullish.  
From overbought levels, a decline below +100 combined with a trend line break may be considered bearish.  
A study of 43,297 backtested trades found the CCI indicator effective with specific settings on particular timeframes.  
Testing the CCI over a 20‑year period (01/02/2003‑01/31/2023) showed it outperformed a buy‑and‑hold strategy on the S&P 500.  
The most reliable CCI setting was identified as CCI(50) crossing up through the –100 level on a daily chart.  
The study reported a 1,108 % return over 20 years using the CCI, versus a 555 % return for S&P 500 buy‑and‑hold.  
The CCI indicator can be unreliable on individual stocks, shorter timeframes, or with suboptimal settings.  
Using the CCI on 5‑minute charts is not recommended due to poor performance.
