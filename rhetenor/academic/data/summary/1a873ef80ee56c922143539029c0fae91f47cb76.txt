CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.  
A security is deemed oversold when the CCI dips below –100 and overbought when it exceeds +100.  
From oversold levels, a buy signal might be given when the CCI moves back above –100.  
From overbought levels, a sell signal might be given when the CCI moves back below +100.  
A positive divergence below –100 increases the robustness of a signal based on a move back above –100.  
A negative divergence above +100 increases the robustness of a signal based on a move back below +100.  
Trend line breaks can be used to generate trading signals.  
Trend lines can be drawn connecting peaks and troughs.  
From oversold levels, an advance above –100 combined with a trend line breakout could be considered bullish.  
From overbought levels, a decline below +100 combined with a trend line break could be considered bearish.  
A study of 43,297 backtested trades found the CCI indicator effective with specific settings on particular timeframes.  
Testing the CCI indicator over a 20‑year period from 01/02/2003 to 01/31/2023 found it outperformed a buy‑and‑hold strategy on the S&P 500.  
The most reliable settings were CCI(50) crossing up through the –100 value on a daily chart.  
The results suggest a 1,108 % return over 20 years, versus the S&P 500 buy‑and‑hold performance of 555 %.  
The CCI indicator has proven effective on specific timeframes, but on individual stocks, shorter timeframes, and with suboptimal settings it can be unreliable.  
Using CCI on 5‑minute charts is not recommended due to poor performance.
