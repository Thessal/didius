When momentum slows, settlement prices retreat from the upper boundaries of the range, causing the stochastic indicator to turn down at or before the final price high.  
An alert is present when the %D line is in an extreme area and diverging from price action, and the signal occurs when the %K line crosses the %D line.  
Divergence-convergence indicates that market momentum is waning and a reversal may be forthcoming.  
A divergence in stochastics relative to price forecasts a reversal in price direction.  
A “stochastic pop” occurs when prices break out and continue upward, signaling to increase the position or liquidate if the direction is adverse.
