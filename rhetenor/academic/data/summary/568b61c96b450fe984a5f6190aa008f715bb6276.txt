When momentum slows, settlement prices retreat from the upper boundaries of the range, causing the stochastic indicator to turn down at or before the final price high.  
An alert is present when the %D line is in an extreme area and diverging from price action, and the signal occurs when the %K line crosses the %D line.  
Divergence between stochastic lines indicates waning market momentum and a potential reversal.  
A divergence in stochastic indicators relative to price can forecast a price reversal.  
A “stochastic pop” occurs when prices break out and continue moving, signaling to increase the position or liquidate if the direction is adverse.
