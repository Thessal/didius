The EMA of m₀ with period n is calculated as EMA(m₀,n) = (2/(n+1))[m₀ − EMA(m₁,n)] + EMA(m₁,n).  
The EMA smoothing period for momentum (r) is typically 25.  
The EMA smoothing period for smoothed momentum (s) is typically 13.  
The TSI output is bounded between +100 and −100, but most values fall between +25 and −25.  
Blau suggests interpreting TSI values near +25 and −25 as overbought and oversold levels, respectively, where a trader may anticipate a market turn.  
The slope of the TSI indicates trend direction: a rising TSI suggests an up‑trend, and a falling TSI suggests a down‑trend.
