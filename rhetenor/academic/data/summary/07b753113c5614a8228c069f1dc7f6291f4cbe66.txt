EMA(m₀, n) = (2/(n+1)) [m₀ − EMA(m₁, n)] + EMA(m₁, n).  
The EMA smoothing period for momentum (r) is typically 25.  
The EMA smoothing period for smoothed momentum (s) is typically 13.  
The TSI output is bounded between +100 and –100, but most values fall between +25 and –25.  
Blau suggests interpreting TSI values of +25 and –25 as overbought and oversold levels, respectively, where a trader may anticipate a market turn.  
Trend direction is indicated by the slope of the TSI; a rising TSI suggests an up‑trend, and a falling TSI suggests a down‑trend.
