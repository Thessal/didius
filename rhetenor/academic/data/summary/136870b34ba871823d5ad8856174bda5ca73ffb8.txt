"Significant positive returns were found on contrarian moving‑average, channel breakout, and Bollinger Band buy trades after 0.50% transaction costs.",36,5,3,4,1,5,5,2
"The contrarian version means buying when the conventional rule mandates selling, and vice versa.",14,5,2,5,1,5,5,1
"A recent study examined Bollinger Band trading strategies combined with the ADX for equity indices and reported similar results.",22,4,3,4,1,5,5,2
"In 2012 Butler et al. published a particle‑swarm‑optimization method for fitting Bollinger Band parameters.",20,5,2,5,1,5,5,1
"Their results indicated that tuning parameters to a specific asset and market improved out‑of‑sample trading signals versus default parameters.",28,5,3,4,1,5,5,2
"Security price returns have no known statistical distribution and exhibit fat tails compared to a normal distribution.",23,4,3,4,1,4,5,1
"A sample size of 20 is too small for reliable conclusions from techniques like the central limit theorem.",23,5,3,4,1,5,5,1
"Statistical techniques usually require independent, identically distributed samples, which security price series do not satisfy.",24,5,3,4,1,5,5,1
"Practitioners recognize that price series are commonly serially correlated, meaning each price is often closely related to its predecessor.",24,4,4,4,1,4,5,1
"Adjusting for serial correlation is the purpose of moving standard deviations that use deviations from the moving average.",18,4,3,4,1,4,5,1
"It is incorrect to assume that the long‑term proportion of future data outside Bollinger Bands will always be fixed.",32,5,3,5,1,5,5,1
"Studies have found that only about 88% (85–90%) of security prices remain within the Bollinger Bands.",15,5,3,4,1,5,5,1
"Practitioners may also use Keltner channels or Stoller average range channels, which base widths on price volatility measures rather than standard deviation.",44,3,4,3,2,3,4,3
"Bollinger Bands have been applied to manufacturing data to detect defects in patterned fabrics.",15,5,2,5,1,5,5,1
"In this application the upper and lower Bollinger Bands are sensitive to subtle changes.",16,4,3,4,1,4,5,1
