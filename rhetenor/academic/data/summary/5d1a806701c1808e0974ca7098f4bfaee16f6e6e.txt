KST equals the weighted sum of MOV(ROC,AVG) terms for four periods.,11,5,1,5,1,5,5,5
MOV(ROC1,AVG1) denotes the AVG1‑day moving average of ROC1.,8,5,1,5,1,5,5,5
Martin J. Pring recommends specific parameter values for short‑term trends.,10,4,5,3,1,2,5,4
Recommended parameter values: X1=10, X2=15, X3=20, X4=30, AVG1‑4=10,10,10,15, W1‑4=1,2,3,4.,14,4,5,3,1,2,5,4
The KST formula is incorporated in technical analysis software like MetaStock and OmniTrader.,13,5,1,5,1,3,5,5
If KST falls below its 9‑day EMA, initiate a short position at the next opening price.,16,5,3,4,2,2,5,5
If KST rises above its 9‑day EMA, close the short position at the next opening.,15,5,3,4,2,2,5,5
KST can be computed on daily or long‑term timeframes.,9,5,2,5,1,5,5,5
KST is built on a 24‑month dominant timeframe, half of a 4‑year business cycle.,14,5,1,5,1,5,5,5
KST performs best when the security follows a primary up‑ and downtrend aligned with the business cycle.,16,4,5,3,1,2,5,4
A simple 10‑day moving average should be used.,8,5,3,4,2,2,5,5
A moving‑average crossover can be anticipated when KST has turned and price breaks a trendline.,15,4,5,4,1,2,5,4
KST reversed downward before the upward trendline was broken.,9,5,1,5,1,5,5,5
A valid trendline breach indicates that upside momentum has faded, leading KST to cross below its moving average.,18,4,5,4,1,2,5,4
MACD traditionally signals buys and sells when crossing its EMA signal line.,12,5,1,5,1,5,5,5
The approach is imperfect; chart ellipses highlight all whipsaws.,9,4,3,3,1,2,5,4
KST can produce false or misleading signals, exemplified by the April 2005 buy signal.,14,4,5,3,1,2,5,4
Overall, KST is more accurate despite occasional whipsaws.,8,4,5,3,1,2,5,4
