After calculating the initial Relative Strength Index (RSI), only the previous day's data is required for the next calculation.  
When used properly, the RSI is a very valuable tool for interpreting chart movement.  
The RSI indicates tops and bottoms when it moves above 70 or below 30, and it usually tops out or bottoms out before the actual market top or bottom, signaling an imminent reversal or significant reaction.  
The RSI can display graphic chart formations such as head‑and‑shoulders, pennants, or triangles that may not be obvious on the bar chart, indicating breakouts and buy or sell points.  
Failure swings of the RSI above 70 or below 30 are very strong indications of a market reversal.  
Support and resistance areas often appear clearly on the RSI before they become apparent on the bar chart.  
Support and resistance lines drawn using RSI points are often analogous to trend lines drawn using bar chart points.  
Divergence between price action and the RSI is a very strong indicator of a market turning point.  
RSI‑price divergence occurs when the RSI is increasing while price movement is flat or decreasing.  
RSI‑price divergence occurs when the RSI is decreasing while price movement is flat or increasing.
