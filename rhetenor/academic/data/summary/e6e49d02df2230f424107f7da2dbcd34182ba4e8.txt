After calculating the initial Relative Strength Index (RSI), only the previous day's data is required for the next calculation.  
When used properly, the RSI is a very valuable tool for interpreting chart movement in stock trading.  
The RSI indicates tops and bottoms when it moves above 70 or below 30, usually before the actual market top or bottom, signaling an imminent reversal or significant reaction.  
The RSI can display graphic chart formations such as head‑and‑shoulders, pennants, or triangles that may not be obvious on the price bar chart, indicating breakouts and buy or sell points.  
Failure swings of the RSI above 70 or below 30 are very strong indications of a market reversal.  
Areas of support and resistance often appear clearly on the RSI before becoming apparent on the price bar chart.  
Support and resistance lines drawn using RSI points are often analogous to trend lines drawn using price bar chart points.  
Divergence between price action and the RSI is a very strong indicator of a market turning point.  
Divergence occurs when the RSI is increasing while price movement is flat or decreasing, and conversely when the RSI is decreasing while price movement is flat or increasing.
