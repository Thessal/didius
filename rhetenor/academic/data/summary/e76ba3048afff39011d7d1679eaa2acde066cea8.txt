The basic increment of directional movement is the largest part of today’s range that is outside yesterday’s range.  
If the largest part of today’s range is above yesterday’s range, the directional movement (DM) is plus; if it is below yesterday’s range, DM is minus.  
Directional movement must be expressed relative to range, i.e., as a function of true range.  
True range is defined as the largest of: today’s high minus today’s low, today’s high minus yesterday’s close, or today’s low minus yesterday’s close.  
True range is always considered a positive number.  
The Directional Indicator (DI) is calculated by dividing directional movement by true range.  
+DI = (+DM) / TR and –DI = (–DM) / TR.  
+DI represents the percent of the true range that is up for the day; –DI represents the percent that is down.  
To make DI a usable tool, the DI values are summed over a period, commonly 14 days.  
+DI14 = +DM14 / TR14 and –DI14 = –DM14 / TR14.  
The term “minus DM” describes downward movement and is not treated as a negative number in the equation.  
An accumulation technique allows calculation of new +DM14 and –DM14 without retaining 14 days of raw data.  
Today’s +DM14 = Previous +DM14 – (Previous +DM14 / 14) + Today’s +DM.  
Today’s –DM14 = Previous –DM14 – (Previous –DM14 / 14) + Today’s –DM.
