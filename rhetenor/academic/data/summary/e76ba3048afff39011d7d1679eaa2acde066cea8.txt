The basic increment of directional movement is the largest part of today’s range that is outside yesterday’s range.  
If the largest part of today’s range is above yesterday’s range, the directional movement (DM) is plus; if it is below yesterday’s range, DM is minus.  
Directional movement must be expressed relative to range, i.e., divided by the true range.  
True range is the largest of (1) today’s high minus today’s low, (2) today’s high minus yesterday’s close, and (3) today’s low minus yesterday’s close, and it is always a positive number.  
The directional indicator (DI) is calculated as directional movement divided by true range.  
+DI = (+DM) / TR and –DI = (–DM) / TR.  
+DI represents the percent of the true range that is up for the day; –DI represents the percent that is down.  
To obtain a usable DI, the DI values are summed over a period, commonly 14 days.  
+DI14 = +DM14 / TR14 and –DI14 = –DM14 / TR14.  
The term “minus DM” describes downward movement and is not treated as a negative number in the equation.  
An accumulation technique allows calculation of new +DM14 and –DM14 without keeping 14 days of data, providing a smoothing effect.  
Today’s +DM14 = Previous +DM14 – (Previous +DM14 / 14) + Today’s +DM.  
Today’s –DM14 = Previous –DM14 – (Previous –DM14 / 14) + Today’s –DM.
