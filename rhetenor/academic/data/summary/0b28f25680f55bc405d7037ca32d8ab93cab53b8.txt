The concept of computing implied volatility dates to Black and Scholes' 1973 paper introducing the Black–Scholes model for valuing options.  
An option‑implied volatility of an asset can be computed by equating the asset option's market price to its valuation formula.  
In the VIX, the option prices used are the S&P 500 index option prices.  
The VIX takes as inputs the market prices of call and put options on the S&P 500 index for near‑term options with more than 23 days until expiration and next‑term options with less than 37 days until expiration, along with risk‑free U.S. Treasury bill interest rates.  
Options are ignored in the VIX calculation if their bid prices are zero or if their strike prices are outside the level where two consecutive bid prices are zero.  
The goal of the VIX is to estimate the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options at an average expiration of 30 days.
