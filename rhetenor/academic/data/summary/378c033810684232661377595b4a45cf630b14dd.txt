"Trix is a technical analysis oscillator developed in the 1980s by Jack Hutson.",23,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"It shows the slope of a triple‑smoothed exponential moving average.",13,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"The name Trix comes from \"triple exponential.\"",7,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"TRIX is a triple‑smoothed exponential moving average used to follow trends.",15,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"Positive TRIX values indicate bullish trends; negative values indicate bearish trends.",15,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"TRIX crossing zero signals a trend change.",7,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"A TRIX signal line is a shorter‑period moving average used to anticipate the TRIX line’s direction.",21,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"TRIX crossing above its signal line suggests the price will likely rise.",14,4,5,4,1,4,5,4
"TRIX crossing below its signal line suggests the price will likely fall.",14,4,5,4,1,4,5,4
"Trix is calculated with a given N‑day period as follows.",10,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"Smooth prices using an N‑day exponential moving average (EMA).",11,5,5,5,1,4,5,4
"Smooth that series using another N‑day EMA.",7,5,5,5,1,4,5,4
"Smooth a third time using a further N‑day EMA.",9,5,5,5,1,4,5,4
"Calculate the percentage difference between today’s and yesterday’s value in the final smoothed series.",14,5,5,5,1,4,5,4
"The triple EMA is a smoothing of price data and is trend‑following.",18,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"Trix shows the slope of the line, being positive in uptrends, negative in downtrends, and crossing zero at trend changes.",46,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"The triple‑smoothed EMA differs greatly from a plain EMA.",10,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"In a plain EMA recent days dominate, but triple smoothing spreads weight more broadly, giving older days higher weight.",47,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"A graph illustrates the weightings for an N=10 triple EMA.",17,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"The distribution’s mode lies at pN‑2’s weight, e.g., p8 has the highest weighting.",20,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"An N of 1 is invalid.",6,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
"The easiest way to calculate the triple EMA is to apply the EMA three times, creating single, double, then triple‑smoothed series.",27,5,5,5,1,4,5,4
"The triple EMA can be expressed directly in terms of prices with f = (N‑1)/(N+1).",31,5,5,5,1,4,5,3
