NVI and PVI are commonly associated with Fosback's versions, while Dysart is the original inventor of these indicators.  
It cannot be said that one version of NVI or PVI is better than the other.  
Fosback provided a more objective interpretation of the indicators, whereas Dysart's versions are valuable for identifying primary trends and short‑term trend reversals.  
Some traders use Fosback's NVI and PVI to analyze individual stocks, but the indicators were created to track and have been tested on major market indexes.  
NVI was Dysart's most invaluable breadth index, and Fosback found that his version of the Negative Volume Index is an excellent indicator of the primary market trend.  
Traders can benefit from both innovations.
