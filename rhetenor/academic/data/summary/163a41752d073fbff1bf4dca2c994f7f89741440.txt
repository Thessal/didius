Elliott frequently used the term "circle" to refer to a cycle on stock charts.  
The term "depression" is sometimes used to describe prolonged market downturns.  
Some writers describe the 13‑year triangle of the DJIA (1928‑1942) as a "throw" that always exceeds the top of wave 3.  
During a rise, the volume of wave 5 does not exceed the volume of wave 3 and is sometimes less.  
As long as volume increases, the next rise is formed, continuing until a rise occurs without an increase in volume.  
Wave 2 volume is smaller than wave 1 volume.  
The word "cycle" means circle, and this property sometimes appears on stock charts.  
When a chart forms a downward rounding in segment C, the pattern is complete because the number of waves suggests that one or more three‑wave formations may occur by the end of the downward movement.  
An accelerated ascent follows in segment D after the downward rounding in segment C.  
The overall pattern of ascent and descent resembles the combined segments C and D, i.e., the lower half of the circle.  
The many strikes at the end of 1945 are a swing of the pendulum from left to right, moving from point 1 to 2 and then to 3.  
The bottom of A‑B sometimes consists of double or triple triplets, especially when a rounding bottom is formed.  
The formation of the bottom of A‑B indicates that wave 2 is forming and wave 3 will follow.  
The bottom of A‑B is suitable for describing the first two waves of the extended wave plane.
