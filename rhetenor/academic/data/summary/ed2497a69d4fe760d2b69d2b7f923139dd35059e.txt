The Negative Volume Index (NVI) and Positive Volume Index (PVI) are technical analysis indicators used to identify primary market trends and reversals.  
In 1936 Paul L. Dysart, Jr. created two series of advances and declines based on whether daily volume was greater or lesser than the prior day's volume.  
Dysart named the series for days with higher volume the Positive Volume Index (PVI) and the series for days with lower volume the Negative Volume Index (NVI).  
Dysart believed that volume is the driving force in the market.  
NVI is calculated by adding the difference between advances and declines to a cumulative total on days when today's volume is less than yesterday's volume, and retaining the previous NVI value on days when volume is higher.  
PVI is calculated in the same way as NVI but applied to days when today's volume exceeds the prior day's volume.  
Both NVI and PVI can be computed on a daily or weekly basis.  
Initially Dysart thought PVI would be more useful, but by 1967 he concluded that NVI proved to be the most valuable breadth index.  
Dysart referred to NVI as AMOMET, an acronym for “A Measure Of Major Economic Trend.”  
According to Dysart’s theory, when volume and price move together the price move is considered good, especially if it persists when volume later subsides.  
If prices rise on positive‑volume days and remain elevated during subsequent low‑volume days, the move is deemed “good.”  
If the market maintains its level on negative‑volume days after advancing on positive‑volume days, the market is in a strong position.  
Dysart described the PVI as the “majority” curve.
