The Negative Volume Index (NVI) and Positive Volume Index (PVI) are technical analysis indicators used to identify primary market trends and reversals in financial markets.  
In 1936 Paul L. Dysart, Jr. began accumulating two series of advances and declines distinguished by whether volume was greater or lesser than the prior day's volume.  
Dysart named the cumulative series for days when volume exceeded the prior day's volume the Positive Volume Index (PVI) and the series for days when volume was lower the Negative Volume Index (NVI).  
Dysart believed that volume is the driving force in the market.  
Dysart calculated NVI by subtracting declines from advances on days when today's volume is less than yesterday's, adding the difference to a cumulative total starting at zero, and retaining the current NVI reading on days when volume is greater than the prior day's volume.  
He calculated PVI in the same manner but for days when volume exceeds the prior day's volume.  
NVI and PVI can be calculated on a daily or weekly basis.  
Initially Dysart thought PVI would be more useful, but by 1967 he wrote that NVI had proved to be the most valuable of all breadth indexes.  
Dysart relied most on NVI, naming it AMOMET, an acronym for “A Measure Of Major Economic Trend.”  
Dysart’s theory stated that if volume advances and prices move up or down in accordance with volume, the move is assumed to be a good movement, especially if it is sustained when volume subsides.  
According to Dysart, after prices have moved up on positive‑volume days, if prices stay up when volume subsides for a number of days, the move is considered “good.”  
He asserted that if the market holds its own on negative‑volume days after advancing on positive‑volume days, the market is in a strong position.  
Dysart referred to the Positive Volume Index as the “majority” curve.
