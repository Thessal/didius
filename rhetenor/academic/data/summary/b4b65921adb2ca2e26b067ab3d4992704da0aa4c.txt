The Money Flow Index (MFI) accumulates volume (or dollar‑volume approximation) rather than price‑change amounts, unlike the Relative Strength Index (RSI).  
Marek and Čadková (2020) found that, across randomized tests on multiple companies such as Apple, ExxonMobil, IBM, and Microsoft, the MFI can outperform a simple buy‑and‑hold strategy, indicating it can be useful for trading.  
Marek and Čadková (2020) reported that the commonly recommended MFI settings in the literature provide no trading advantage and that optimal settings must be calibrated for each individual stock.  
On‑balance volume, price and volume trend, and accumulation/distribution index are additional price‑volume indicators used in stock trading.
