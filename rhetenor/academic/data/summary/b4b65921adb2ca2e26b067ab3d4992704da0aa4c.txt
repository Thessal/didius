The Money Flow Index (MFI) uses volume (or dollar‑volume approximation) as its scale, unlike the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which uses price‑change amounts.  
Marek and Čadková (2020) found that the MFI can outperform a simple buy‑and‑hold strategy, indicating it can be useful for stock trading.  
They also found that the MFI parameter settings commonly recommended in the literature provide no trading advantage, so settings must be optimized for each individual stock.
