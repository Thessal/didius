In a complete cycle of the stock market, the number of minor waves is 144.  
The table shows that a complete market cycle contains 5 primary bullish waves, 3 primary bearish waves, 21 intermediate bullish waves, 13 intermediate bearish waves, 89 secondary bullish waves, and 55 secondary bearish waves, totaling 144 waves.  
All wave numbers belong to the Fibonacci series and the entire sequence is used in the stock market cycle.  
The wavelength may change, but the number of waves does not.  
Through experience the author found that 144 is the largest number of practical value in stock market cycles.  
Dividing any two adjacent Fibonacci numbers, such as 55 ÷ 34, yields approximately 1.618, and the reverse division yields approximately 0.618.
