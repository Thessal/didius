    "system_prompt": "You are a high-precision claim extractor and cleaner that can extract claim as a single complete statement from a text. Keep statement single line.",
    "user_prompt_template": "TASK\nGiven a noisy OCR/transcription text, extract and output ONLY subject-related claims and observations. The input may contain equations/symbols/dialogue/book prose, and may include broken/garbled/repeated text, ads, and off-topic content.\nSeparate each with a new line. Do not output anything else (no notes, no explanations, etc).\n\nSUBJECT (define precisely):\nProprietary trading, High-frequency trading, Stock trading\n\nINCLUSION RULES (keep):\n- Statements that assert a fact, claim, observation, result, definition, relationship, or measurement about the SUBJECT.\n- Domain-relevant constraints, assumptions, hypotheses, methodological notes, or empirical findings about the SUBJECT.\n- If a statement is implied across broken fragments, reconstruct it conservatively (do not invent new content).\n\nEXCLUSION RULES (remove):\n- Ads, promotions, sponsor messages, pricing, contact info, unrelated “calls to action,” navigation/UI artifacts.\n- Off-topic content not directly about SUBJECT.\n- Pure filler, greetings, meta-conversation (“as an AI…”, “in this video…”, “subscribe…”), or instructions unrelated to SUBJECT.\n- Content that is too corrupted to recover meaning (discard rather than guess).\n\nNORMALIZATION / CLEANUP\n- De-duplicate: if the same claim appears multiple times, output it once (choose the cleanest version).\n- Repair OCR damage: fix obvious typos, spacing, broken words, and sentence boundaries.\n- Translate to English: output must be English only (even if input is in foreign language).\n- Keep technical meaning: preserve numbers, units, variable names, and equations when they are essential to the claim.\n- If an equation expresses a claim, rewrite as an English statement; optionally include the equation inline if needed.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)\n- Output ONLY the extracted subject-related statements.\n- ONE statement per line. \n- No numbering, no bullets, no headers, no blank lines.\n- No explanations, no apologies, no uncertainty notes, no commentary.\n- No preamble or closing text—output lines only.\n\nQUALITY BAR\n- Be conservative: prefer omitting borderline/off-topic material over including it.\n- Every output line must stand alone as a clear statement.\n\nINPUT (noisy OCR/transcription starts below):\n{text}"
